# Sophie and The Odd Ones

The first book in the **Sophie Feegle** series introduces readers to Gwen DeMarco's signature blend of supernatural mystery, snarky heroines, and the weird and wonderful world of urban fantasy.

## Synopsis

Sophie Feegle needs a break. Rent is due on her crappy apartment, she's halfway through her last loaf of bread, and her ambitions don't stretch much further than keeping her landlord off her back and scraping together enough cash for whiskey at the neighborhood bar.

When a chance encounter with a quiet stranger leads to a job offer at the San Francisco City Morgue, Sophie jumps at it. She never expected to find her calling on the graveyard shift, surrounded by dead bodies and the strange characters that make up the morgue's staff. Finding out that your friends and coworkers are shifters, ogres, and other non-human creatures is a shock—but Sophie quickly realizes these are her people, and she's finally found her perfect gig.

And then things get odd. Well… odder. Unusual murders keep ending up on Sophie's autopsy table, hinting at strange powers at work within the city. Something nefarious is building in San Francisco, and it's up to Sophie and her friends to thwart the evil on the rise.
