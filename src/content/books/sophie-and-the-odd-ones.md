# Sophie and The Odd Ones

The first book in the **Sophie Feegle** series introduces readers to Gwen DeMarco's signature blend of supernatural mystery, snarky heroines, and the weird and wonderful world of urban fantasy.

## Synopsis

Sophie Feegle thought she had her life figured out. A steady job at the San Francisco City Morgue, a comfortable routine, and absolutely no complications. Then the bodies started getting weird.

When supernatural creatures begin showing up on her examination table, Sophie's ordinary existence takes a sharp turn into the extraordinary. Shifters, ogres, vampires—they're all real, and they're all dead. Now Sophie has to figure out why, and more importantly, who's responsible.

With a cast of quirky characters, a grumpy love interest, and more supernatural surprises than she can handle, Sophie is about to discover that San Francisco's underworld is a lot more literal than she ever imagined.

## What Makes This Book Special

- **Snarky Heroine**: Sophie is exactly the kind of protagonist who isn't afraid to say what she's thinking
- **Grumpy Love Interest**: A male lead who growls more than he smiles—just the way we like it
- **Found Family**: Discover a cast of oddballs who become Sophie's unlikely support system
- **Urban Fantasy Setting**: San Francisco comes alive with supernatural secrets lurking in every shadow
- **Paranormal Mystery**: Who—or what—is killing the odd ones?
