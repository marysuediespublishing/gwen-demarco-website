# Portents and Oddities

The second book in the **Sophie Feegle** series plunges Sophie into a serial killer investigation when she starts seeing murder victims in her dreams before they end up on her autopsy table.

## Synopsis

After defeating a Fae fanatic bent on closing the portal between earth and the magic realm, Sophie Feegle is ready for a breather. Back at the morgue doing the autopsy assistant job she loves, she's looking forward to whiskey at her favorite ogre pub and maybe even a date with a certain sexy fox shifter. Spoiler: the universe has other plans.

When Sophie recognizes the body on her autopsy table from a dream, her world is shaken all over again. More bodies follow, and it becomes clear that a serial killer is hunting San Francisco's Mythicals. But why? And why is Sophie seeing the victims in her dreams before they die?

As Sophie and her crew chase down the killer, they encounter Mythicals with strange and dangerous powers. But the deeper they wade into these treacherous waters, the more uncertain it becomes: are Sophie and her friends the hunters, or are they the ones being hunted?
