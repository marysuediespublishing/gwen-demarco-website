# Portents and Oddities

The second book in the **Sophie Feegle** series continues the supernatural mystery as Sophie discovers that her newfound knowledge of the odd ones comes with consequences.

## Synopsis

Sophie Feegle barely survived her introduction to San Francisco's supernatural underground. Now she's back at the morgue, trying to pretend that her world hasn't been turned completely upside down. Spoiler: it's not working.

When strange omens start appearing—ones that even the odd ones find alarming—Sophie realizes her troubles are just beginning. Bodies are showing up with marks that make the seasoned supernaturals nervous, and everyone seems to think Sophie is somehow connected.

Whether she likes it or not, Sophie is being pulled deeper into the world of shifters, vampires, and things that go bump in the night. And the portents are clear: something wicked this way comes.

## What Makes This Book Special

- **Deeper Lore**: Discover more about the supernatural world and its complex politics
- **Growing Stakes**: The threats are bigger, and Sophie's found family is at risk
- **Snarky Heroine**: Sophie's wit remains sharp even when the danger escalates
- **Grumpy Love Interest**: More tension, more growling, more slow-burn romance
- **Mystery and Mayhem**: What do the portents mean, and why is Sophie at the center?
