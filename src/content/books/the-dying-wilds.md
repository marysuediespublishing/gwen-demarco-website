# The Dying Wilds

The thrilling conclusion to the **Kingdom of Erishum Trilogy** brings Nyssa and Vallen's journey to its epic end.

## Synopsis

The Dying Wilds are as lethal as ever—and Vallen and Nyssa are heading straight back in.

Five Tributes face a sacrificial ritual, and no one else is coming to save them. Armed with magical wellspring water and the hard-won survival instincts of former gutter rats, Vallen and Nyssa fortify their campsite against the deadly hyvas and launch a desperate rescue mission into the wilds that nearly killed them before.

But freeing the captives is only the beginning. When they emerge from the wilds ready to return to Puzur, they discover that the kingdom of Erishum has fallen to ruin in their absence. King Jorek's tyranny has tightened its grip, and there is no safe haven left to retreat to—only the choice between standing against a king or watching their people suffer.

Two gutter rats against a kingdom's worth of enemies. The odds have never been worse. But courage, sacrifice, and sheer stubborn determination have carried them this far, and Vallen and Nyssa aren't done fighting yet.
