# The Dying Wilds

The thrilling conclusion to the **Kingdom of Erishum Trilogy** brings our hero's journey to its epic end.

## Synopsis

The wilds are dying. What once was untamed and powerful is now fading, and with it goes the last hope for those who refuse to bow to tyranny.

From mudlark to gutter shrike, our hero has risen through blood and betrayal. Now, as the kingdom tears itself apart and the ancient powers that once protected the realm draw their final breaths, there's nowhere left to rise—only the choice between fighting for a dying world or watching it burn.

The forces arrayed against our hero have never been more dangerous. Old enemies return with new weapons, while allies reveal secrets that change everything. In a land where the magic itself is failing, victory will require sacrifices that no one is prepared to make.

But perhaps that's what it means to fight for something bigger than survival. Perhaps the dying wilds can be reborn—if someone is willing to pay the price.
