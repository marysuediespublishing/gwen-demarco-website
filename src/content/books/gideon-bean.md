# Gideon Bean

The first book in the **Auras & Embers** series introduces readers to a world where some can see the true nature of everyone around them—and where that gift makes you a target.

## Synopsis

Gideon Bean has always known he was different. Seeing things—scary, bizarre visions that no one else can see—he's learned to keep his head down and ignore the strange world around him. It's safer that way. The last time he reacted to one of his so-called hallucinations, he ended up in a psychiatric hold. He can't let anything like that happen again.

So he keeps it simple: night shifts burning corpses at Peterson Cremation Services, days at Sheryl's Shell Shack. Nothing exciting. Exactly how he prefers it.

Then a woman with flaming wings and fiery eyes crawls out of a crematorium oven.

Dacey Menet is a bennu shifter—a Mythical reborn in fire. She's investigating a series of local murders and disappearances, and she is enraged to have become one of the victims. Now she needs Gideon's help to catch her killer. Because it turns out his "hallucinations" are real—Gideon Bean can see magic.

Suddenly, Gideon finds himself caught between shadowy organizations that want to exploit his rare ability and a dangerous world he never knew existed. The supernatural underground has its own factions, alliances, and rules—and someone who can see magic is valuable, rare, and hunted.

Now Gideon must learn to navigate this hidden world fast if he wants to survive. And then there's the fiery, sharp-tongued bennu shifter who seems determined to drag him into the thick of it whether he likes it or not.
