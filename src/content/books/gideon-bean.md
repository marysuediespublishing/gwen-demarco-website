# Gideon Bean

The first book in the **Auras & Embers** series introduces readers to a world where some can see the true nature of everyone around them—and where that gift makes you a target.

## Synopsis

Gideon Bean has always known she was different. Seeing colors around people, sensing their emotions, knowing when someone is lying—she's learned to hide her abilities and stay under the radar. It's safer that way.

But when she witnesses something she can't explain and attracts the attention of the supernatural underground, her carefully built anonymity crumbles. Suddenly, Gideon finds herself caught between bennu shifters whose phoenix fire could burn her to ash and shadowy organizations that want to use her gift for their own purposes.

An auramancer—that's what they call her. Someone who can see auras, read intentions, and perceive the supernatural nature of any being. And auramancers are rare, valuable, and hunted.

Now Gideon must learn the rules of a world she never knew existed—fast—if she wants to survive. The supernatural underground has its own factions, alliances, and dangers for those who can see beyond the veil.

And then there's the grumpy bennu shifter who seems determined to protect her whether she likes it or not.
