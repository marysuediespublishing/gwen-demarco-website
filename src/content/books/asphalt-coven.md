# Asphalt Coven

The first book in the **Witches of Kirra Cross** series where five women discover powers they were never supposed to have — and someone is already hunting them for it.

## Synopsis

**Darby wasn't looking for magic. She was looking for a fresh start.**

One accidental spell in a dusty library archive changes everything – binding her to four women she's only just begun to call friends, and awakening power none of them knew they had.

But magic has enemies.

A violent order called the Torch Bearers has been hunting witches for generations. They've already burned other covens out of existence. Now they're coming for Darby's.

Five women. No training. No time. And a bond forged in concrete, grit, and the kind of magic that refuses to die.

**This isn't a story about peaceful garden witches.** **This is a coven that won't burn.**

*Perfect for fans of The Craft, A Discovery of Witches, and fierce female-led urban fantasy*

## What Makes This Book Special

* * **Starting from Nothing:**

     Darby Hendricks is divorced, broke, and rebuilding her life in Medeon — a rust-belt city that's as rough around the edges as she feels. The last thing she expected was to discover she's a witch.

  * **Grit Over Glamour:**

     No enchanted forests. No charming villages. This is urban fantasy with asphalt under its nails — water-stained apartments, graffiti-tagged subways, and magic practiced in an abandoned cemetery because where else would a bunch of city witches go?

  * **Found Family, Forged in Fire:**

     Five women from different walks of life form a coven not by destiny but by circumstance — and become the fierce, foul-mouthed family none of them knew they needed.

  * **Real Women, Real Problems, Real Magic:**

     These women have jobs, bills, ex-husbands, and bad apartments. They're not chosen ones — they're ordinary women navigating extraordinary power with sharp humor and sharper elbows.

  * **The Torch Bearers:**

     An ancient order of witch hunters is operating in Medeon, and the coven's very existence has put targets on their backs. But these women aren't running — they're the Asphalt Coven, and they're made of grit, dirt, and attitude.
