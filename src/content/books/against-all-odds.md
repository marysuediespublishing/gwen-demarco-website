# Against All Odds

The fourth book in the **Sophie Feegle** series pushes our heroine to her limits as the stakes rise higher than ever before.

## Synopsis

Sophie Feegle has come a long way from the woman who thought supernatural creatures were the stuff of fiction. Now she's neck-deep in San Francisco's paranormal underworld, and she wouldn't have it any other way—even if "her way" involves dead bodies, dangerous politics, and a grumpy protector who makes her heart race.

But when an ancient threat emerges that could destroy everything the odd ones have built, Sophie finds herself at the center of a conflict that spans centuries. The supernatural community is fractured, old alliances are crumbling, and everyone is looking to Sophie for answers she doesn't have.

With enemies closing in from all sides and her loved ones in danger, Sophie must make impossible choices. The odds have never been more stacked against her—but Sophie Feegle has never been one to back down from a fight.
