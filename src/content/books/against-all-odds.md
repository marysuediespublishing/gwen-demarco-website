# Against All Odds

The fourth book in the **Sophie Feegle** series pushes our heroine to her limits as the stakes rise higher than ever before.

## Synopsis

Sophie has come back home to try and come to grips with her new reality: She’s a Fae, not human, and her memories have been stolen. Oh, and she’s a shard – a fractured piece of... someone.

All Sophie knows is that the ‘someone’ she used to be angered the Fae queen, who then split her into five separate beings and scattered them on earth. But why? And why take their memories?

The Odd Ones, now including Ruby – who Sophie thought was a long-long twin sister but is actually also one of the shards – are on a quest to find all the missing shards. The question is: How will they find the other three?

And if that wasn’t enough, a new important death vision leads Sophie, Mac, and Ruby on a new mission to Las Vegas. Posing as high rollers, the crew must track the killers and shut down the illegal shifter fight club where the murder took place. At least *that* will take Sophie’s mind off how truly bizarre her life has become.

While on the case, new visions and new friends give Sophie some hope that she can figure herself out. But the Odd Ones will need to hurry – they aren't the only ones trying to find the lost shards.

## What Makes This Book Special

* **Identity Crisis:** Sophie must come to terms with a reality-shattering revelation — she's not human, she's Fae, and she's only a fragment of who she used to be
* **Vegas, Baby:** A death vision sends the crew undercover as high rollers to infiltrate an illegal shifter fight club — because nothing says "taking your mind off an existential crisis" like hunting killers in Sin City
* **Romance Deepening:** Sophie's relationship with her grumpy other half grows stronger as he becomes her anchor in a world where she's no longer sure who — or what — she is
* **The Shard Hunt:** With five pieces scattered across the earth and stolen memories hiding the truth, the Odd Ones must find the remaining three shards before someone else gets to them first
* **Found Family Redefined:** Ruby isn't a long-lost twin — she's another shard. The Odd Ones are expanding, bonds are shifting, and family is being rebuilt from the ground up in ways none of them expected
