# Odd Times for Sophie Feegle

The third book in the Sophie Feegle series sends our favorite morgue attendant to the Mythical town of Murias, where fairy-tale creatures live among humans, murders are piling up, and nothing—especially family—is what it seems.

## Synopsis

Sophie Feegle has finally found her footing in San Francisco's supernatural world. Famous last words.

When a series of bizarre, unsolved murders threatens to expose the Mythicals living quietly in the quaint Cascadian town of Murias, Marcella—head of the Fae Conclave—dispatches Sophie and her fox shifter boyfriend Mac to find the killer. The timing is critical: Murias's Hunter's Moon Festival, Cascadia's largest Mythical event, is less than a week away. It also doesn't hurt that leaving San Francisco gets Sophie away from a wolf shifter pack out for blood after the death of their alpha.

There's just one complication. Well, several. The Conclave wants Sophie to work closely with her newly discovered twin sister Ruby. Ruby has her own supernatural abilities, but she's also everything Sophie is not: bubbly, cheerful, and a "reformed" serial killer.

At least Sophie gets to meet Mac's family and maybe even enjoy the festival—if she can solve the murders first. But as always with Sophie, things in Murias start to get very, very odd.
