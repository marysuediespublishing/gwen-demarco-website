# Odd Times for Sophie Feegle

The third book in the **Sophie Feegle** series takes our favorite morgue attendant on a journey through time, mystery, and the increasingly complicated supernatural politics of San Francisco.

## Synopsis

Sophie Feegle has survived two supernatural crises and is starting to think she might actually be getting the hang of this whole "knowing about the odd ones" thing. Famous last words.

When bodies start showing up with impossible timestamps and witnesses report seeing people in two places at once, Sophie's logical mind rebels. Time doesn't work like that—except apparently in San Francisco's supernatural underground, it does.

The odd ones are nervous, which means Sophie should be terrified. Something is messing with the fabric of reality itself, and once again, all signs point to Sophie being in the middle of it. With her grumpy protector by her side and her found family at her back, Sophie must unravel a mystery that spans decades—before time runs out for everyone.

## What Makes This Book Special

- **Temporal Twists**: Time isn't just money—it's a weapon, and someone knows how to use it
- **Deeper Relationships**: Sophie's bond with the odd ones grows stronger and more complicated
- **Fae Involvement**: New supernatural players enter the game with their own agendas
- **Slow-Burn Romance**: The tension between Sophie and her grumpy protector reaches new heights
- **Found Family**: When reality itself is unstable, family is the anchor that keeps you grounded
