# Odds and Ends

The epic conclusion to the **Sophie Feegle** series brings all the threads together in a satisfying finale that fans have been waiting for.

## Synopsis

Sophie Feegle has been through hell and back—sometimes literally. She's faced down ancient threats, navigated supernatural politics, and found love with her grumpy protector. But there are still loose ends that need tying up, and Sophie has never been one to leave a job unfinished.

When the dust settles from the battle that nearly destroyed everything, Sophie discovers that some enemies don't stay defeated and some secrets refuse to stay buried. The supernatural community is rebuilding, but cracks are already forming in the fragile peace.

As Sophie works to protect her found family and secure their future, she must confront the consequences of every choice she's made. Friends become enemies, enemies become unlikely allies, and Sophie learns that the hardest battles aren't always the ones fought with claws and fangs.
