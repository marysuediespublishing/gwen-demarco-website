# Odds and Ends

The epic conclusion to the **Sophie Feegle** series brings all the threads together in a heart-pounding finale that fans have been waiting for.

## Synopsis

Sophie Feegle has been through hell and back—sometimes literally. She's faced down ancient threats, navigated supernatural politics, and fallen for the grumpiest man in San Francisco. But when a cryptic message from the Great Mother sends her on a mission to uncover her own erased past, Sophie realizes the fight is far from over.

Her quest leads her to Queen Maeve's former stronghold on Earth, where she discovers a shocking truth about her history—and the destiny she never asked for. As Maeve's hybrid soldiers prepare to launch a full-scale attack on San Francisco, Sophie must journey to other realms, rally an army, and confront a darkness that threatens to consume everything she holds dear.

But the greatest threat might come from within. Sophie's dark magic is growing stronger, and the secrets of her past could unravel everything she's built—including herself. With her loyal friends and newfound allies at her side, she must face her deepest fears and embrace her true identity before it's too late.

In this final adventure, Sophie Feegle will discover who she truly is—and what she's willing to sacrifice for a happy ending.
