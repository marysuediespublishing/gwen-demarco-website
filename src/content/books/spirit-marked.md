# Spirit Marked

The second book in the **Auras & Embers** series continues Gideon Bean's journey deeper into the supernatural world—where being marked by spirits is both a gift and a curse.

## Synopsis

Gideon Bean survived her introduction to the supernatural underground. She's accepted her role as an auramancer and even found an unlikely protector in a certain grumpy bennu shifter. But just when she thinks she's figured out the rules, everything changes.

A spirit mark—ancient, powerful, and impossible to hide—has appeared on her skin. It's a beacon to every supernatural being within sensing distance, announcing her presence like a flare in the darkness. And not everything that notices is friendly.

The spirits beyond the veil are watching now. Some want to use her. Some want to consume her. And some have been waiting for someone like her for a very long time.

As Gideon navigates new alliances and old enemies, she must learn to control abilities that are growing stronger by the day. The supernatural underground is full of factions vying for power, and an auramancer who can see truth and communicate with spirits is a prize worth fighting over.

With her grumpy bennu shifter by her side and her found family at her back, Gideon must choose: hide from what she's becoming, or embrace the spirit mark and discover just how deep the supernatural world goes.
