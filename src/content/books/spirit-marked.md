# Spirit Marked

The second book in the **Auras & Embers** series continues Gideon Bean's journey deeper into the supernatural world—where seeing the invisible can make you the only one standing between the living and the dead.

## Synopsis

Since discovering his ability to see magical auras, Gideon Bean has embraced his new role as an auramancer working for the Conclave. He's found his footing in the supernatural world and even found an unlikely connection with a certain fiery bennu shifter. But just when he thinks he's figured out the rules, everything changes.

Five people in Millhaven are dead—no cause, no connection. A tattoo artist, a nurse, a homeless man, members of the town's elite. When Dacey Menet, the bennu shifter who burst into his life in a blaze of fire, brings him in to investigate, Gideon discovers something chilling: void-like magical signatures where life force once existed. Something is draining souls, and it isn't done.

The victims seem to have nothing in common, and every lead only raises more questions. Then Dacey becomes the next target—and suddenly the investigation turns personal.

As Fourth of July celebrations light up Millhaven, Gideon must unravel the mystery before the woman he's falling for becomes nothing but an empty shell. With time running out and a soul-stealer growing bolder, Gideon has to push his auramancer abilities further than ever—because if he fails, Dacey's eternal flame will be extinguished forever.
