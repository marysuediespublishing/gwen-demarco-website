# The Mudlark

The first book in the **Kingdom of Erishum Trilogy** marks Gwen DeMarco's foray into epic fantasy, delivering her signature character-driven storytelling in a richly imagined world.

## Synopsis

The Kingdom of Erishum is corrupt. Nyssa just doesn't know it yet.

Towering border walls protect Erishum's citizens from the Dying Wilds and its monsters. Within those walls lies a kingdom of bustling marketplaces, powerful priests, and opulent festivals — and beneath it all, the Shadow District, where Nyssa scrapes by as a mudlark on the banks of the River Assur. She's close to leaving that life behind for the warm ovens of a baker's apprenticeship. All she needs is a little more money.

When she unearths a mysterious object that could buy her way out, she accidentally sets foot on a path filled with unseen threats, deceit, and political intrigue. Evading the menacing Enumerii priests and the king's shrikes, Nyssa is pulled deeper into a world of danger, betrayal, and sacrifice — and forced to confront a terrible choice: save her future or save an old friend.

What do you do when everything you've ever been taught is a lie?
