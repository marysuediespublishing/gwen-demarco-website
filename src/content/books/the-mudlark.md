# The Mudlark

The first book in the **Kingdom of Erishum Trilogy** marks Gwen DeMarco's foray into epic fantasy, delivering her signature character-driven storytelling in a richly imagined world.

## Synopsis

In the dying kingdom of Erishum, survival means knowing your place. For those at the bottom—the mudlarks who scavenge the riverbanks for scraps of value—that place is in the muck.

But when an unexpected discovery changes everything, one mudlark must navigate a world of political intrigue, ancient magic, and monsters called Hyvas that lurk in the wilds beyond civilization's reach.

With danger at every turn and allies who may be enemies in disguise, the journey from the gutters to something greater has never been more treacherous—or more thrilling.
