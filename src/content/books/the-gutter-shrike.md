# The Gutter Shrike

The second book in the **Kingdom of Erishum Trilogy**. Vallen survived the Dying Wilds and the monstrous hyvas — but the secret he carries back could be far more dangerous than anything he faced on the sacrificial mound.

## Synopsis

Vallen was once one of the king's shrikes. Then he was a traitor. Then a sacrifice. Now he's something Erishum doesn't have a word for — a dead man walking back through the gates with the truth.

*The Gutter Shrike* is what they call a shrike stripped of rank and honor, dragged through the mud and left for dead. King Jorek and Grand Enumerox Berossus meant it as a death sentence. But sometimes the ones you throw away are the ones who see your kingdom most clearly — from the bottom up, where all the rot is visible.

With Nyssa at his side and the horrors of the Dying Wilds behind them, Vallen must now face a threat no blade or map can navigate: the political machinery of an irreconcilably corrupt kingdom determined to bury its secrets — and anyone who carries them.

## What Makes This Book Special
