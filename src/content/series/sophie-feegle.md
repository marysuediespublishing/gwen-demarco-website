title: Sophie Feegle Series
description: >-
  Sophie Feegle needs a break. Rent is due on her crappy apartment and she's
  halfway through her last loaf of bread.


  Sophie doesn't have big ambitions. She only wants a job that will keep her landlord off her back, enough extra cash for whiskey at the neighborhood bar and a bit of free time to hang out with the naughty old lady next door.


  When a chance encounter with a quiet stranger leads to a job offer at the San Francisco City Morgue, Sophie jumps at the opportunity. She never expected to find her calling on the graveyard shift surrounded by dead bodies and the strange characters that make up the morgue's staff. Finding out that your friends and co-workers are shifters, ogres and other non-human creatures is a shock, but Sophie quickly realizes that these are her people, and she has finally found her perfect gig.


  And then things get odd. Well… odder.


  Follow Sophie and the Odd Ones as they solve murders and uncover secrets that lead them to the other side of the world... and beyond.

# Sophie Feegle Series

*Welcome to San Francisco, where the dead don't always stay dead and the living aren't always what they seem.*

## Series Overview

Sophie Feegle thought she was just an ordinary woman working at the San Francisco City Morgue. But when she discovers an unusual ability – she can see a person's final moments – her world turns upside down. What those visions reveal is a hidden world of shifters, ogres, vampires, fae, and other supernatural beings living among humans. Now Sophie is caught up in their dangerous world, and she's not navigating it alone. With the help of her ragtag group of friends, the Odd Ones, Sophie must untangle supernatural politics, ancient grudges, and deadly threats while trying to keep her job – and her life.

## The World of the Odd Ones

San Francisco has always been a city of secrets. Behind the fog and famous hills, supernatural beings have carved out their own territories and alliances.

Sophie's position at the morgue gives her an unusual vantage point – she sees what happens when that peace breaks down. And with her newly awakened magical abilities, she becomes a target for those who would use her gifts for their own purposes. And those who want to hide their heinous crimes.

## The Series

### Book 1: Sophie and The Odd Ones (2020)

**The Beginning**

A morgue attendant discovers she can see a person's final moments – and what they reveal changes everything.

Sophie Feegle's life changes forever when her unusual ability exposes a hidden world of shifters, ogres, vampires, and fae living among humans – and she learns she's not entirely human herself. Suddenly thrust into a dangerous supernatural underworld, Sophie must learn the rules fast if she wants to survive.

**Featuring**: Urban fantasy mystery, supernatural discovery, snarky heroine

### Book 2: Portents and Oddities (2021)

**The Plot Thickens**

Sophie's new life among the Odd Ones gets complicated when she starts dreaming about the dead – *before* they end up on her autopsy table.

After defeating a Fae fanatic, Sophie was hoping for some downtime – whiskey at her favorite ogre pub, maybe a date with a certain sexy fox shifter. But when a serial killer starts hunting San Francisco's Mythicals, and Sophie is seeing the victims in her dreams, she and her crew must track down the killer before they become the next targets.

**Featuring**: Supernatural intrigue, deepening mysteries, found family

### Book 3: Odd Times for Sophie Feegle (2022)

**The Stakes Rise**

*Things are getting weird – even by Odd One standards.*

When bizarre murders threaten to expose the Mythicals in the quaint town of Murias just days before Cascadia's largest supernatural festival, Sophie gets sent to investigate – partly to solve the case, and partly because a wolf shifter pack back in San Francisco wants her dead. The catch? The Conclave wants her working with her newly discovered twin sister Ruby, who is bubbly, cheerful, and a "reformed" serial killer. At least Sophie's fox shifter boyfriend Mac is along for the ride.

**Featuring**: Escalating danger, relationship development, supernatural action

### Book 4: Against All Odds (2023)

**The Crisis**

*When everything Sophie thought she knew about herself shatters, she has to pick up the pieces – literally.*

Sophie is reeling from a devastating revelation: she's not human, her memories have been stolen, and she's a shard – a fractured piece of someone who angered the Fae queen. Now she and the Odd Ones, including Ruby, who turns out to be another shard rather than a twin sister, are racing to find the remaining three pieces. But when a death vision sends Sophie, Mac, and Ruby to Las Vegas to infiltrate an illegal shifter fight club, Sophie discovers she's not the only one hunting for the lost shards.

**Featuring**: High stakes, emotional depth, epic confrontations
