# Sophie Feegle Series

*Welcome to San Francisco, where the dead don't always stay dead and the living aren't always what they seem.*

## Series Overview

Sophie Feegle thought she was just an ordinary woman working at the San Francisco City Morgue. But when bodies start arriving with marks that shouldn't exist, Sophie discovers she can see what others can't—the Odd Ones. Shifters, ogres, vampires, fae, and other supernatural beings have been living among humans all along, and now Sophie is caught up in their dangerous world.

As a fae changeling raised among humans, Sophie must learn to navigate supernatural politics, ancient grudges, and deadly threats while trying to keep her job—and her life.

## The World of the Odd Ones

San Francisco has always been a city of secrets. Behind the fog and famous hills, supernatural beings have carved out their own territories and alliances. The Odd Ones maintain an uneasy peace, governed by rules that have existed for centuries.

Sophie's position at the morgue gives her an unusual vantage point—she sees what happens when that peace breaks down. And with her newly awakened fae abilities, she becomes a target for those who would use her gifts for their own purposes.
