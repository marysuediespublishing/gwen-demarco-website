# Kingdom of Erishum Trilogy

*In a dying kingdom, the lowest may rise the highest—if they survive.*

## Series Overview

The Kingdom of Erishum was once a land of power and plenty. Now the wilds are dying, corruption spreads through the land, and ancient evils stir in the shadows. Into this crumbling world comes an unlikely hero—a mudlark, a gutter shrike, a survivor who has nothing left to lose.

This epic fantasy trilogy follows one woman's journey from the riverbanks where she scavenges for scraps to the heart of a kingdom's darkest secrets. Along the way, she'll discover that the line between savior and destroyer is thinner than she ever imagined.

## The World of Erishum

The Kingdom of Erishum exists in a world where magic has a price and the natural order is failing. The wilds that once flourished are dying, corrupted by a spreading blight that no one can explain. The kingdom's rulers seem powerless—or perhaps unwilling—to stop the decay.

Society is brutally divided. The nobility live in their towers, removed from the suffering below. Merchants and craftsmen keep the economy moving. And at the bottom, the mudlarks and gutter shrikes—the scavengers and survivors—eke out existence in the margins, invisible to those above.

But when the kingdom needs saving, it won't be the nobles who answer the call.

## The Trilogy

### Book 1: The Mudlark (2023)
**The Beginning**

*She was born in mud and raised in shadows. Now she must rise.*

A mudlark is the lowest of the low—someone who scavenges the riverbanks for anything of value, surviving on scraps and the leavings of others. Our heroine has known nothing else. But when she discovers something in the mud that should not exist, she's thrust into a world of ancient magic and deadly politics.

Suddenly, powerful people are very interested in the girl from the riverbank. And in the Kingdom of Erishum, that kind of attention is rarely good.

**Featuring**: Dark fantasy, unlikely heroine, dangerous discoveries

---

### Book 2: The Gutter Shrike (2023)
**The Transformation**

*From mudlark to gutter shrike—predator, not prey.*

Survival in the Kingdom of Erishum requires adaptation. Our heroine has learned that being invisible won't save her—she needs to become something more. The gutter shrike is a survivor who has moved beyond scavenging, who takes what she needs and protects what's hers.

But as she gains power, she also gains enemies. The corruption spreading through the kingdom has a source, and there are those who will do anything to protect it.

**Featuring**: Character evolution, political intrigue, rising stakes

---

### Book 3: The Dying Wilds (2024)
**The Reckoning**

*The wilds are dying. The kingdom is falling. And only she can stop it—or burn it all down.*

Everything has led to this. The corruption has a name and a face, and our heroine must confront it before the dying wilds consume everything. But stopping the blight may require sacrifices she never imagined—and becoming something she never wanted to be.

In the end, saving the kingdom might mean destroying everything it once was.

**Featuring**: Epic conclusion, ultimate sacrifices, bittersweet triumph
