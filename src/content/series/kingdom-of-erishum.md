# Kingdom of Erishum Trilogy

*In a dying kingdom, the lowest may rise the highest—if they survive.*

## Series Overview

The Kingdom of Erishum is an ancient land protected by massive walls from the deadly Dying Wilds beyond. But inside those walls, corruption festers at the kingdom's core, the Enumerii priests tighten their grip, and King Jorek rules through fear and his brutal enforcers—the shrikes. Into this world comes Nyssa, a mudlark scavenging the riverbanks with nothing to her name, whose discovery of a mysterious object will drag her from the gutter into a web of political intrigue, dangerous secrets, and a fight for survival she never asked for.

This cozy fantasy trilogy follows Nyssa's journey from the slums of Erishum to the heart of the kingdom's darkest secrets—and beyond the walls into the Dying Wilds themselves. Along the way, her bond with Vallen, a childhood friend and former shrike condemned as a sacrifice to the monstrous hyvas, will be tested as they uncover a truth that could shatter the kingdom's very foundations.

## The World of Erishum

The Kingdom of Erishum exists behind ancient walls that hold back the Dying Wilds—a deadly expanse where monstrous creatures called hyvas roam and danger presses ever closer. No one goes beyond the walls willingly. Those who do are sacrifices, not explorers.

Inside, society is brutally divided. The Enumerii priests control religious authority and wield enormous influence. The king's shrikes enforce order through violence. Merchants and craftsmen keep the economy turning. And at the bottom, the mudlarks and gutter rats—the scavengers and survivors—scrape by in the margins, invisible to those above.

But when the kingdom needs saving, it won't be the priests or the king who answer the call. It'll be the ones they threw away.

## The Trilogy

### Book 1: The Mudlark (2023)

**The Beginning**

*She was born in mud and raised in shadows. Now she must rise.*

A mudlark is the lowest of the low—someone who scavenges the riverbanks for anything of value, surviving on scraps and the leavings of others. Our heroine has known nothing else. But when she discovers something in the mud that should not exist, she's thrust into a world of ancient magic and deadly politics.

Suddenly, powerful people are very interested in the girl from the riverbank. And in the Kingdom of Erishum, that kind of attention is rarely good.

**Featuring**: Dark fantasy, unlikely heroine, dangerous discoveries

### Book 2: The Gutter Shrike (2023)

**The Transformation**

*From shrike to sacrifice—condemned, not defeated.*

Vallen was once one of the king's shrikes, an enforcer who survived in the shadows of Erishum's brutal hierarchy. Now he stands accused of treason, condemned alongside four others to be sacrificed to the monstrous hyvas that roam the Dying Wilds. His only lifeline: a shadowy map and a religious amulet slipped to him by Nyssa, his childhood friend.

Against terrible odds, Vallen escapes the sacrificial mound—but not before uncovering a secret so dangerous it could shatter the very foundations of Erishum. A secret guarded by King Jorek and Grand Enumerox Berossus themselves.

Now he must go back. Back through the walls, back into the kingdom's corruption, to save Nyssa from a fate neither of them saw coming. And when escape is the only option left, their path leads straight through the perilous heart of the Dying Wilds—where hyvas, treacherous landscapes, and startling revelations await at every turn.

**Featuring**: Character evolution, political intrigue, rising stakes

### Book 3: The Dying Wilds (2024)

**The Reckoning**

*The Dying Wilds are no longer something to flee—they're the battlefield.*

Vallen and Nyssa venture back beyond the walls on a desperate mission: save five Tributes from the sacrificial mound before the hyvas claim them. Armed with magical wellspring water and sheltered within a fortified campsite, they face the lethal wilds head-on to rescue the innocent.

But freeing the captives is only the beginning. When they discover the ruin Erishum has become since their escape, retreat to Puzur is no longer an option. King Jorek's tyranny has gone unchecked, and there is no one left to stop him—except two former gutter rats who were never supposed to survive this long.

In the trilogy's gripping climax, Nyssa and Vallen must do what once seemed unthinkable: rise from the margins to confront the king himself. Saving their people will demand every ounce of courage and sacrifice they have left—if the Dying Wilds don't consume them first.

**Featuring**: Epic conclusion, ultimate sacrifices, bittersweet triumph

## What Makes This Series Special

### Slow Burn Romance

True to Gwen DeMarco's style, the romance is a slow burn — Vallen, brave and steadfast, has loved Nyssa for longer than he'd ever admit, seeing past her mud-stained exterior to the strength within long before she saw it herself.

The Kingdom of Erishum is a harsh world, but the series never loses its heart. Found family, unexpected alliances, and moments of hope shine through the darkness.
