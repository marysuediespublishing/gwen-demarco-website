# Auras & Embers Series

*Some people see colors. Gideon Bean sees souls.*

## Series Overview

Welcome to a world where the supernatural hides in plain sight, visible only to those with the gift—or curse—of seeing auras. Auramancers are rare, valuable, and often in danger. They see what others cannot: the true nature of every being around them, from mundane humans to ancient supernatural creatures.

Gideon Bean didn't ask for this ability. She definitely didn't ask to be drawn into a world of bennu shifters with phoenix fire in their veins, restless spirits with unfinished business, and supernatural factions that would kill to control an auramancer's gifts.

But the weird and wonderful have found her, and Gideon is about to discover that seeing the truth is only the beginning.

## The World of Auras & Embers

The supernatural world exists parallel to our own, invisible to most humans but thriving in the shadows. Those with the ability to see auras can perceive the truth that others miss—the shimmer of a shifter's animal nature, the cold void of a vampire, the flickering flame of a bennu.

Auramancers are highly sought after. Their ability to see through deception makes them valuable allies and dangerous enemies. Many don't survive long once they're discovered.

Gideon Bean is about to learn just how dangerous being special can be.

## The Series

### Book 1: Gideon Bean (2024)
**The Awakening**

*She sees auras. They see prey.*

Gideon Bean has always known she was different. Seeing colors around people, sensing their emotions, knowing when someone is lying—she's learned to hide her abilities and stay under the radar. But when she witnesses something she can't explain and attracts the attention of the supernatural underground, her carefully built anonymity crumbles.

Now she's caught between bennu shifters whose phoenix fire could burn her to ash and shadowy organizations that want to use her gift for their own purposes. Gideon must learn the rules of a world she never knew existed—fast—if she wants to survive.

And then there's the grumpy bennu shifter who seems determined to protect her whether she likes it or not.

**Featuring**: Urban fantasy, auramancer abilities, phoenix shifters, snarky heroine

### Book 2: Spirit Marked (2025)
**The Deepening**

*The dead have unfinished business. Gideon Bean is about to become part of it.*

Gideon thought learning about bennu shifters was complicated enough. But when spirits start seeking her out, drawn to her auramancer abilities, she discovers that seeing auras was only the beginning of her gifts.

Spirit marked and increasingly powerful, Gideon attracts the attention of beings who have been watching from the shadows—ancient supernatural entities who have their own plans for an auramancer who can see and speak to the dead.

With her grumpy bennu shifter by her side and new allies who may have their own agendas, Gideon must navigate the dangerous waters between the living and the dead.

**Featuring**: Expanded powers, spirit encounters, relationship development, supernatural politics
