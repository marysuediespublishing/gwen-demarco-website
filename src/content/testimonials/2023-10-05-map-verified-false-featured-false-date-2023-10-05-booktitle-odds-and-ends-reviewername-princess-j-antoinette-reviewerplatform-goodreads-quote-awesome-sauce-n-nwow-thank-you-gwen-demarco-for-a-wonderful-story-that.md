  Awesome Sauce!


  Wow, thank you Gwen DeMarco, for a wonderful story that was full of love, family, friendship, deception, the twists and the turns and most of the win and a HEA.


  What an epic adventure you have provided your readers with Gwen. I'm thoroughly impressed with your cleverness of your written words for this storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat with the need of wanting more!


  BRAVO Gwen, BRAVO! (A Recommended Book Series To Read)
