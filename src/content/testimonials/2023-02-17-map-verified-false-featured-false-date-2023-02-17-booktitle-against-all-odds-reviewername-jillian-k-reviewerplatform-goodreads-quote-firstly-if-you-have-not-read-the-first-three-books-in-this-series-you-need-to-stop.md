quote: Firstly, if you have not read the first three books in this series, you
  need to stop and immediately read this series, in order. Firstly the main
  characters are awesome, especially together. the relationships feel holistic,
  the books and the conversations are hilarious. It is sweet, but also a little
  nerve wracking. It honestly has everything I want to read in a story. Each
  book gets better and better. I knew this was going to be a good story, but
  Gwen really knocked it out of the park! The twist, oh the twist! You will
  never see coming! Read and enjoy one of my absolute favorite series!!!
