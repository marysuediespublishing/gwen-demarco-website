  Thoughly engaging

  Loved it! Very different from her previous books. Upbeat and engaging. A very poor young woman making her living by digging relics from the river that runs through her town. She and the rest of the population have been lied to about what is beyond the huge wall that surrounds the town thinking that they are the only people in this land. She makes a dangerous discovery in the river that challenges her beliefs. The government wants to suppress her curiosity making her an outlaw. Wonderful and a cliffhanger! Can’t wait for the next book!
