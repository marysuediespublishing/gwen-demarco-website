  Better and better

  9/10 This series is fantastic! I can’t believe it’s not more popular because it’s easily the same caliber as Kate Daniels and Mercy Thompson . This far in the twists are starting to build and it’s so satisfying. The pacing was still slightly unusual but improved from the last book. There are also enough big revelations that even if you guess a few of them there are still plenty more to enjoy. I will eagerly be awaiting the next installment
