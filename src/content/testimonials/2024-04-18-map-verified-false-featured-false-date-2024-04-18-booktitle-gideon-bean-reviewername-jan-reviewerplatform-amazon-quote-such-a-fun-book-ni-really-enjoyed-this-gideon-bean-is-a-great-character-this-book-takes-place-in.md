  Such a fun book

  I really enjoyed this. Gideon Bean is a great character. This book takes place in the same world as Sophie Feegle but is situated in the Florida Panhandle rather than San Francisco. Interestingly, Gideon works in a crematorium. Sophie Feegle works in a morgue. I’m sensing some synchronicity with death workers discovering their magical heritage.


  Gideon is an auramancer. He can sense magical essence. He grew up believing he was human, but an encounter with Dacey, a type of phoenix shifter, started him down his road of magical discovery.


  Gideon’s acceptance and coming into his power occur in the context of magical serial killings taking place in the area. The mystery was tight and well plotted. The characters were nicely developed and fun to adventure with. Gwen DeMarco is a skilled writer who creates characters and a world you’ll love getting to know. I’m looking forward to a second book to see what happens to Gideon now that he’s getting proper training.
