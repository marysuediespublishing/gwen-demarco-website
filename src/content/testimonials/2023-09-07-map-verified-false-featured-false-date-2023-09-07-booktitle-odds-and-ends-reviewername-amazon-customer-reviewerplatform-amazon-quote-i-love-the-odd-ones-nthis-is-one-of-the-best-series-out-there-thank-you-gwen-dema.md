  I love the Odd Ones!

  This is one of the best series out there. Thank you, Gwen DeMarco, for creating such quirky, snarky, endearing characters. It has been a wild ride from beginning to end, from book to book. I have never waited so impatiently for a next book to come out, or felt so sad to see a story end, though it ended masterfully. There were no loose ends and I felt satisfied at the natural ending. Yes, there could be spin-offs, and they would be most welcome, but I don't feel deprived of anything at this point and to me, that is the mark of a good story, well told.
