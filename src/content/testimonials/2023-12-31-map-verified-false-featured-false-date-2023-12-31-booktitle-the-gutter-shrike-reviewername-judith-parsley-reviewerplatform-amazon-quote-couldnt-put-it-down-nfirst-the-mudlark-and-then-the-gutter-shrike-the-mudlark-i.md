  Couldn't put it down

  First, The Mudlark and then The Gutter Shrike. The Mudlark is short, more of a novella, but beautifully crafted. The length is perfect to set up the decay of the kingdom of Erishum and the lives of the characters. From start to finish I was on the edge of my seat, not able to put the book down. Ms DeMarco took the story to places I couldn't foretell. The story continues in The Gutter Shrike, riveting and full of possibilities and danger. A journey for two souls in every sense of the word. Highly recommend this series!
