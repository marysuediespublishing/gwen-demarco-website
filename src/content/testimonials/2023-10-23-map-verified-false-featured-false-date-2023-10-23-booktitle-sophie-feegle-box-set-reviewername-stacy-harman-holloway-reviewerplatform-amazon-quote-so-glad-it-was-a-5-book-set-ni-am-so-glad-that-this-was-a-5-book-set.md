  So Glad it was a 5 Book Set!

  I am so glad that this was a 5 book set! It was like binge eating chocolate or watching a Shonda Rhimes’ TV show!

  I adore mythical creatures…fairies, shifters, etc. and this was chock full!

  The characters are richly drawn, the story is intricately built, the romances are just right (the intimate scenes are titillating but not TMI!).

  I started this series because one my favorite authors, Nathan Lowell mentioned it in his newsletter…and I couldn’t put it down.

  The editing was superb, the vocabulary had me checking the dictionary constantly (I love that in a book!).

  This was a delightful read and I recommend it for anyone who likes grown-up fairy tales. ♥️♥️♥️
