  Absolutely love this series!

  It’s an absolute joy to read these books. They have twists, revelations, the whole nine yards. But each book is light and refreshing at the same time. This is the last book in the series and I so sorry to get to the end. Each book topped the last. The characters are all so likable and well fleshed out. The familiar tropes are dusted off and spun in new and interesting directions. I’ve been reading Urban Fantasy ever since it became a genre and these books are everything I love about the genre. Highly recommended.
