  Gideon Bean is a name to remember!


  I really enjoyed Ms. DeMarco’s Sophie Feegle series and this new book is in the same world so it has lots of promise. The titular Mr. Bean is a young man who lives with his mom in the Florida panhandle and has two boring jobs and a fear of ever being sent to the mental facility again. Just keeping his head down and his life boring. That is until the night at his job at the crematorium when the woman started banging on the furnace door. The rest is a whirlwind of new introductions to a world he didn’t know existed much less was a part of and a powerful part of at that. A whirlwind case of magic and evil leads to a tumultuous result where he learns he is much stronger than he ever knew. Great opening to what I hope is a short wait to a second book in the series.
