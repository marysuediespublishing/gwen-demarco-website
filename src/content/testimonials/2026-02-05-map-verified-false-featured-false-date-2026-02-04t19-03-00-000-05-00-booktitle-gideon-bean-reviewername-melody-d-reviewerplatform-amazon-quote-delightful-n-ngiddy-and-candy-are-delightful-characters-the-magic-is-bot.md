  Delightful!


  Giddy and Candy are delightful characters. The magic is both new and familiar with just the right blend so you're not list in a sea of unfamiliar terms. It's humorous, lighthearted with some serious overtones. Just a hint of romance. This book tics all my boxes for an enjoyable entertaining read.


  Highly recommended and I look forward to future books!
