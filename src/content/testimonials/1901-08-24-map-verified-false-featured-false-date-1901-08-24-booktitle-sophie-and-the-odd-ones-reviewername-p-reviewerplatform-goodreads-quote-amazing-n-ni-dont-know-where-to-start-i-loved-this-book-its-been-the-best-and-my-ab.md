  Amazing


  I don't know where to start. I LOVED this book. It's been the best and my absolute favorite of the year. First it's so interesting and entertaining. I had to share with my partner and co workers. Our girl is very smart and witty. She's not your normal beauty queen and she definatly isn't a damsel in distress. At the beginning she is in desperate need of a job and through her kindness she is offered a job at the city morgue. This is where the story gets your attention and doesn't stop until the last word. Partly a shifter story it contains all the elements of the 'fae' world complete with ogres. Her boss is an opposum shifter and all her co workers are shifters as well. She's not put off by the unusual smells or gross body parts that arrive at the morgue and that is amazing since this dept handles all the mystical deaths. She is quickly thrust into an entirely new world and all the things that she never knew existed. She's snarky and funny and just so likable that you instantly want her to do well. I can't wait for the next installment in this series. Our author is extremely talented and I am honestly recommending this as time well spent reading it. Give it a try and you will be as big a fan as me. New novel ideas and a great premise for a new series. Thank you Ms. Demarco... you rock!!!!!
