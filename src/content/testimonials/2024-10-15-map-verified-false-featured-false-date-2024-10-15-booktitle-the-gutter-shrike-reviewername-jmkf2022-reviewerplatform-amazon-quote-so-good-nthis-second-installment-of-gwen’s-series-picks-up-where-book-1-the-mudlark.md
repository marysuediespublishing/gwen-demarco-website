  So good!

  This second installment of Gwen’s series picks up where Book 1, The Mudlark leaves off. Nyssa risked her life to help bring Vallen the tools to save himself and safely get through the dying wilds, only for him to refuse to leave the love of his life Nyssa. Together they venture to safety and to find a life together only to realize they can’t truly be happy without uncovering more secrets from their homeland. Gwen uses book 2 to weave a tale that draws you in and leaves you with a false sense of security. I loved this book and cannot wait for the final book in this Trilogy The Dying Wilds!
