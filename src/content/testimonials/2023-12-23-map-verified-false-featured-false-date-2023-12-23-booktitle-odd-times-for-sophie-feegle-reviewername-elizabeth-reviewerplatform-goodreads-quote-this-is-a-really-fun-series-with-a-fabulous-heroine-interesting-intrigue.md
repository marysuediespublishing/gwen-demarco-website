  This is a really fun series with a fabulous heroine, interesting intrigue, a
  great love interest, and lots of sound family. I adore that Sophie's best
  friend is an old lady!


  The audiobook narrator does a great job of not getting in the way. I just enjoy it and have a great time! Two books to go before I can tell you if it's worth reading the series. There is some overarching mystery that gets more revealed each time but also gets a little bit more mysterious each time.
