  Omgosh, serious and hilarious, PERFECT

  This was not what I expected. It is AWESOME! The perfect blend of serious and humerous. My absolute lol was the pillow, go to the light moment. Lolololol. Y'all need to read this. Stick out the first few chapters, because it really draws you in once the story line is set. Loved this so much!
