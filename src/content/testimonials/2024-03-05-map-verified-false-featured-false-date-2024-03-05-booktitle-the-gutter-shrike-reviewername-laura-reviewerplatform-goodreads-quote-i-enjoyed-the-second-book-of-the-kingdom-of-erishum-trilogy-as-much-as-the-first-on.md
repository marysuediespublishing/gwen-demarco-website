quote: I enjoyed the second book of the "Kingdom of Erishum Trilogy" as much as
  the first one. This book related the tale of Vallen's and Nyssa's travels
  through the "Dying Wilds". Once the audiobook started, I was so captivated by
  the story that I listened until the end without stopping. I enjoyed the
  character growths of Vallen and Nyssa. There were some surprising revelations.
  I'm looking forward to the next book in the trilogy. Janine Granda's narration
  was skillful, and her performance was entertaining. I was given a free copy of
  the audiobook, and I have voluntarily posted this review.
