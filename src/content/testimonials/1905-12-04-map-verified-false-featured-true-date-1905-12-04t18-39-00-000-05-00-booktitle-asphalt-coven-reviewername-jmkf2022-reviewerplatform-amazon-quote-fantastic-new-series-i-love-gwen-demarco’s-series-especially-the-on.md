quote: Fantastic New Series!!! I love Gwen Demarco’s series, especially the ones
  in Sophie Feegles’ world! About 75% of this book is introducing us to the new
  characters and their world. Women from different backgrounds finding
  themselves drawn to each other in friendship not knowing they have magical
  powers, and growing together once they do. Definitely take it all in, because
  one of the best things about Gwen’s writing are her story twists you never see
  coming. I don’t believe in spoilers but let me tell you this, I have read 11
  of Gwen’s books, and I never saw that twist coming. Highly recommend this
  author, series and book!
