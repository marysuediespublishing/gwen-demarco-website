  Great Second in the Series


  Really enjoyed both this book and the previous one. I don't normally read books with male protagonists, but I enjoyed the author's previous series Sophie and the Odd Ones, so I gave this one a try. So glad I did and can't wait for the next one. Really unique world with lots of creative takes on mythology that work amazingly well.
