  Great Conclusion to this Series

  I purchased and listened to this on Audible books.

  This was a well written story with amazing depths to the world building and the various characters. I find this Author's writing very interesting and she basics parts on actual facts, like the Mudlarks. Narrator has done a marvelous job with the various characters voices and the entire storyline.
