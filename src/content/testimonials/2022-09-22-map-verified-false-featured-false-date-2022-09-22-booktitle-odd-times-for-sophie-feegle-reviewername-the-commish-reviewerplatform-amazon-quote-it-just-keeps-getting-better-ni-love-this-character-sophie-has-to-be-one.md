  It just keeps getting better!

  I love this character. Sophie has to be one of my favorite snarky heroines. She's adorable and so smart and gifted, it's easy to she why Mac loves her so. The world building is very skilled and so imaginative. Sophie and Mac have to visit a festival in a nearby magical place and try to solve the latest crisis. I can't stress enough how much you will enjoy the story. Whether you have read the first two or not you will still fall in love with our Mac. He's the best kind of man for Sophie and we learn more about him and his background in this festival. Sophie has a twin sister that is gifted as well and we find out more about this strange situation. Y'all there is alot of wonderful creatures and magical beings and of course lots of romance. Please give this a try. This author is really amazing and she keeps it so interesting. This book has everything you want. Sci-fi romance and new ideas are hard to come by and I know others will love it as well. Sophie is a real superhero to me!!!
