quote: What a satisfying conclusion to this dystopian trilogy! In fact, it is so
  skillfully completed that it absolutely exceeded my expectation. The plot is
  intricate and full of twists I did not see coming; the different storylines
  are fascinating and involve both joy and tragedy; the characters have vivid
  growth, showing courage, loyalty, and determination. The narration of the
  audiobook brings the characters to even greater definition. Definitely
  recommend...this will stay with me for a long time.
