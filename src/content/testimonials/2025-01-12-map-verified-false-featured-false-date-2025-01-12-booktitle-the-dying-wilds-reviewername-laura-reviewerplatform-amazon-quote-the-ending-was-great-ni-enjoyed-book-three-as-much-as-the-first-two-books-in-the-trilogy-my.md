  The Ending was Great

  I enjoyed book three as much as the first two books in the trilogy. My attention was grabbed from the opening paragraphs until the end as I had to find out what happened. I liked Nyssa and Vallen. I admired their commitment to each other and to their desire to save their people. I was entertained by the twists and the almost non-stop action. I was sad that the final chapter of Nyssa's and Vallen's story was complete. I was entertained by Janine Granda's narration, and her performance added to my enjoyment of the story. I received a complimentary copy of the audiobook. I volunteered, without financial gain, to post this review which reflected my honest opinions regarding this audiobook.
