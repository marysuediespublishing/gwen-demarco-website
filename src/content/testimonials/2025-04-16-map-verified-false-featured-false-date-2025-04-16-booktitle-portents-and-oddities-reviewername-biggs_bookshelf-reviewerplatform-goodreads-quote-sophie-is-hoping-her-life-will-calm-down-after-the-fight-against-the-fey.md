quote: Sophie is hoping her life will calm down after the fight against the fey
  at the tower but poor thing can’t catch a break. Her group of odd ones are
  bonding and becoming closer and she is just the human in the middle. Honestly
  she handles all the things really well with tons of snark and sarcasm of
  course lol. But when the people in her dreams and fanciful stories start
  appearing in real life she’s beginning to question her sanity. Having ogres
  and were animals in her life no thing. Dream character on her autopsy table is
  just not okay. This book makes me laugh out loud and keeps the reader guessing
  as to what is coming next. And how can you not love her neighbor. I recommend
  reading the entire series to not miss anything or be confused.
