  Awesome

  This series has a great cast of characters. Each book takes up after the prior book. While there are no glaring cliff hangers after each book, there is an overarching plotline that does not resolve until book 5. The plot is very interesting! It starts with a human woman (Sophie) who is down on her luck, but due to an act of kindness, gets a job as a coroner's assistant. There she learns she has an unusual gift. When she touches a corpse she can see how that person died. As most of the corpses her boss autopsies are mythical people such as wolf shifters and vampires, the deaths are mainly murder. Thus starts her career of helping a mythical detective investigate murders. And she gets the whole autopsy team (her odd ones) involved. Most of the books involve solving a murder. But slowly the overarching plotline is weaved in. Sophie discovers she is less than a person. She has "sisters" who used to be part of her. And their lives are in jeopardy again. So are the lives of all her odd ones. Book 5 had an absolutely awesome ending!!! I loved it. Great series.
