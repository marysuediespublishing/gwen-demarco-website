  Great new series!


  The mudlark is set in a kingdom of great wealth and great suffering. Nyssa is an older mudlark, scraping out a meager living digging in the muds of the river during lowtides. A rare discovery sets events into motion that will change her life forever. I liked the pacing, the worldbuilding was great and Nyssa is a really good character. She was smart, sympathetic, and caring towards her peers. There are quite a few twist at the end of this book and there is a cliffhanger. Is well worth the read for some great fantasy immersion.
