name: Satyr
slug: satyr
description: >-
  Satyrs are ancient supernatural beings rooted in wild magic and primal
  revelry. Often mistaken for mere figures of Greek myth, satyrs are very much
  alive in the modern world—blending into society while maintaining deep ties to
  nature, music, and chaos. Beneath their charming exteriors lies an untamed
  spirit connected to the earth itself.

  Though they've adapted to urban life, satyrs remain creatures of instinct and impulse, drawn to celebration, creative expression, and the wild places that still exist at the edges of civilization. Their presence tends to stir emotions in those around them, making them natural entertainers, provocateurs, and occasionally, trouble.

physicalTraits: In their true form, satyrs display cloven hooves, small curved
  horns, pointed ears, and legs covered in coarse fur from the knee down. Most
  use glamors or sigil tattoos to pass as human, though their builds tend toward
  lean and wiry. Their eyes often carry an amber or golden hue that can be
  difficult to fully conceal.
cultureNotes: Satyrs are social creatures who gather in loose, nomadic groups
  called revels. Leadership is informal, typically falling to the most
  charismatic or musically gifted among them. They value personal freedom above
  all else and have a deep cultural aversion to confinement or obligation. Many
  gravitate toward careers in music, bartending, event planning, or any
  profession that keeps them close to crowds and celebration.
abilities: Satyrs possess nature affinity, allowing them to accelerate plant
  growth, communicate with animals, and sense disturbances in natural
  environments. Their most notable ability is emotional influence—a subtle,
  passive aura that heightens the emotions of those nearby, amplifying joy,
  desire, or unease depending on the satyr's mood. Skilled satyrs can focus this
  into deliberate persuasion through music or speech. They also have enhanced
  stamina, agility, and remarkably quick healing when in contact with natural
  earth.
