name: Auramancers
slug: auramancers
description: Auramancers, also known as sensates, are rare supernatural beings
  with the ability to sense and categorize all forms of magic—from enchantments
  and glamors to ley lines and spiritual energy. Possessing a heightened sixth
  sense attuned to the subtle vibrations of the supernatural, they can perceive
  the true nature of creatures hidden behind sigil tattoos or concealment
  spells. Some auramancers develop their abilities further, learning to see
  souls, sense ley lines, or even detect ghosts and spirits. Nearly immune to
  most magic, they are invaluable as investigators, healers, or hunters,
  offering a glimpse into a hidden world others can only imagine.
