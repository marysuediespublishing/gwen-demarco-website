name: Hyvas
slug: hyvas
description: The hyva is a massive, serpentine creature with glossy indigo-black
  scales, six tree-trunk-thick legs ending in curved sickle-like talons, and a
  snake-like head crowned with a ring of sharp spikes. It has luminous golden
  eyes, an elongated maw filled with dagger-like fangs, a ridge of spines
  running down its back, and a long thorny whip-tail strong enough to shatter
  stone. Before attacking, its throat pouch balloons grotesquely while it
  produces a signature accelerating clicking sound followed by a warbling roar.

physicalTraits: "Picture something that moves like a snake but stands on six
  legs, each one ending in talons that could gut a man in a single swipe. The
  hyva is enormous — large enough to coil its bulk around a stone column and
  still have body to spare. Its hide is a deep indigo-black that shimmers in
  moonlight, stretched over coiled muscle and crowned with a ridge of spines
  from skull to tail-tip. The head is the worst of it: purely reptilian, ringed
  with backward-curving horns and split by a jaw that holds far too many teeth.
  You'll know one is watching you by the gold glow of its eyes in the dark.
  You'll know it's about to attack when the bulging sac at its throat starts to
  pulse and that clicking sound picks up speed."
cultureNotes: Hyva are solitary, territorial creatures that tolerate no company
  — not even their own kind. They roam the Dying Wilds alone, and when two cross
  paths, the result is almost always a brutal, screaming fight that can be heard
  echoing across the forest for miles. There is no pack structure, no
  cooperation, no hierarchy beyond whoever wins the next brawl.
abilities: "Hyva are apex predators built for killing. They're explosively fast
  despite their size, capable of bursting through dense undergrowth and closing
  distance before prey has time to react. Their strength is staggering — a
  single lash of the tail can crack stone, and those sickle-curved talons shred
  through almost anything. They hunt using a three-part vocalization: a low,
  throaty clicking that accelerates as they close in, followed by a warbling
  roar that signals the attack is committed. Sometimes, though, they skip the
  announcement entirely and arrive in silence, which is arguably worse. They can
  also climb, slithering up boulders and rock faces with unsettling ease for
  something so massive. While not intelligent in any reasoning sense, they
  possess a sharp animal cunning — circling to flank, attempting to leap over
  barriers, and assessing threats before committing. They are relentless once
  they've locked onto prey, and pain alone won't stop a charge — only enrage it
  further."

# Hyvas

Hyva are the apex predators of the Dying Wilds, monstrous serpentine beasts that prowl the cursed forest surrounding the kingdom of Erishum. Feared by citizens and soldiers alike, they are the reason no one leaves the kingdom walls and lives to tell about it.
