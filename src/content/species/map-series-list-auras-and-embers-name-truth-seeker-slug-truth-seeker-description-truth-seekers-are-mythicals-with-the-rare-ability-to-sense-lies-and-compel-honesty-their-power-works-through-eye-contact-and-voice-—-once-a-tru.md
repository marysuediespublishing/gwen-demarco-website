name: Truth Seekers
slug: truth-seekers
description: "Truth Seekers are Mythicals with the rare ability to sense lies
  and compel honesty. Their power works through eye contact and voice — once a
  truth seeker locks eyes with their target and begins speaking in that low,
  soothing tone, resistance becomes difficult. The magic feels like hypnosis:
  quiet, subtle, and creeping. To an auramancer, a truth seeker's power
  manifests as gentle tendrils of persuasion that wrap around the mind, washing
  over thoughts in waves of ease and trust. It feels like a comforting hand
  guiding you to reveal your deepest secrets — and even bystanders can get
  caught in the pull if they're not careful. Targets often slip into a
  trance-like state, their voices going sleepy and robotic, their will bending
  to answer whatever questions are asked. Truth seekers are invaluable for
  interrogations, able to cut through deception and pull confessions from even
  the most reluctant subjects. The Conclave uses them to question suspects,
  verify alibis, and determine whether someone is an accomplice or simply in the
  wrong place at the wrong time."
