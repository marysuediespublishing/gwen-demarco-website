description: Witch magic is linked to the life force of the world itself,
  inherited from mother to daughter through bloodlines as ancient as humanity.
  It is a divine gift that allows women to manipulate the elemental energies
  around them. All witches share a fundamental spark — the connection to the
  life force that flows through every living thing. Beyond that universal spark,
  each witch possesses a unique elemental affinity that resonates with her soul.
  This affinity cannot be forced or chosen, only discovered.

physicalTraits: "Physically indistinguishable from ordinary humans. Witches come
  in every age, body type, and ethnicity — there is no outward marker of what
  they are. When actively channeling magic, subtle physical signs may manifest:
  a crackle of static energy across the skin, hair lifting as if charged, or a
  faint glow in the eyes that reflects their elemental affinity. These signs are
  often brief and easily missed."
cultureNotes: Witches are exclusively female, with magic passing only through
  the maternal line. While covens — typically groups of five — are considered
  the ideal, many witches live and practice alone. Some are solitary by choice,
  preferring independence over the vulnerability of shared bonds. Others simply
  never find their people — the gift is rare enough that a witch may go her
  entire life without meeting another. Coven-bonded witches are stronger and
  safer, their magic amplified by sisterhood, but lone witches compensate with
  secrecy and self-reliance. Across all witch culture, discretion is paramount.
  Centuries of persecution have made hiding in plain sight less a strategy than
  a survival instinct.
abilities: All witches share a fundamental connection to the life force that
  flows through every living thing. Beyond this universal spark, each witch
  possesses a unique elemental affinity — the element that resonates most
  strongly with her soul. Known affinities include earth, air, fire, water,
  lightning, and written words, though the full range remains uncatalogued.
  Affinities cannot be chosen or forced, only discovered. Early in their
  development, witches rely on ritual structure to channel their power —
  incantations, sigils, crystals, herbs, and tools such as athames and chalices.
  With practice, these aids become unnecessary, and a fully realized witch can
  shape her element through will and intent alone. Coven-bonded witches are
  significantly more powerful than solitary practitioners, their shared bond
  amplifying each member's individual abilities. Witches can also craft
  protective objects such as witch balls and wards to detect or repel threats.

# Witches

Born with magic in their blood and targets on their backs, witches have survived centuries of persecution through secrecy, sisterhood, and sheer stubborn refusal to burn.
