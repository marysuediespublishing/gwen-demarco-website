physicalTraits: Inhumanly beautiful and eternally youthful, frozen at the age of
  their turning. Pale skin ranging from porcelain white to an unearthly pallor.
  Retractable fangs that extend when feeding.
cultureNotes: Vampire society is hierarchical and political, with many vampires
  belonging to a Domus—a clan or small family unit led by elder, stronger
  vampires. Age equals power, and ancient vampires command respect and fear
  across their territories. A Domus typically keeps humans around to provide
  blood. These humans serve voluntarily, hoping to eventually be transformed
  into vampires themselves. They are called Volos, though many refer to them as
  Veins behind their backs.
abilities: Superhuman strength, speed, and senses that increase with age.
  Immortality and immunity to disease. Ability to mesmerize and control weaker
  minds.
