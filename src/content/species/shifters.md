physicalTraits: Human form appears normal but often with enhanced physical
  attributes—stronger, faster, with keener senses than ordinary humans. Eyes may
  flash with animal nature when emotional.

  based on strength and dominance. Alphas lead, and challenges for leadership
  can be brutal. Territory is sacred.

  half-animal battle form. Enhanced strength and speed even in human form,
  accelerated healing, heightened senses including smell, hearing, and night
  vision.
