  Wizards are among the most versatile and powerful spellcasters in the Mythical
  world. Unlike witches, whose magic is tied to specific elemental affinities
  inherited through bloodlines, wizards practice learned magic — a broad
  discipline of spellwork that can be studied, mastered, and expanded over a
  lifetime. Their power comes not from an innate connection to a single element,
  but from their knowledge of incantations, rituals, and the fundamental forces
  that underpin all magic.


  A skilled wizard can cast an impressive range of spells: containment barriers that trap enemies in invisible bubbles of force, knockout spells that drop a target into immediate unconsciousness, location spells that track missing persons across vast distances, and memory modifications that wipe away what someone has seen. The most powerful wizards are capable of devastating offensive magic — some could level a city block if they chose to unleash their full strength.


  Wizard magic requires spoken incantations, often in ancient or arcane languages that sound like nonsense to untrained ears. The complexity of a spell typically determines how long the incantation takes to complete — simple spells can be cast in moments, while powerful workings require time and concentration, leaving the wizard vulnerable if interrupted. To an auramancer's senses, wizard magic often has a bright, active quality — bubbling, sparkling, or crackling with contained energy.
