description: A type of Mythical with an innate magical ability to perceive
  patterns, anomalies, and connections within data. They can sift through large
  amounts of information—financial records, death certificates, statistics—and
  instinctively detect irregularities that would escape ordinary analysis. Very
  little is known about the Numerai - they are reclusive and secretive.
