name: Bennu shifters
slug: bennu
description: Bennu shifters are supernatural beings rooted in ancient Egyptian
  mythology, believed to be descended from the bennu—the soul of the sun god Ra
  made flesh in the form of a heron. Often considered the origin of the Greek
  and Roman phoenix myths, bennu shifters possess the power of fiery
  regeneration, rising reborn from flame with their wounds healed and strength
  restored. They are stronger and faster than typical humans, immune to fire and
  heat, and can sprout fire wings capable of carrying them short distances. When
  they unleash their full power, they can burn with a touch. True to their
  namesake, bennu shifters can also transform into a heron.

physicalTraits: Bennu shifters are indistinguishable from ordinary humans in
  appearance, allowing them to move through the world undetected. However, when
  they call upon their power, blazing fire wings erupt from their backs, capable
  of carrying them short distances. During moments of heightened emotion—anger,
  passion, or distress—an observant eye might catch a flicker of flame dancing
  in their irises, a subtle but telltale sign of the fire that burns within
  them.
cultureNotes: Unlike many shifter species that organize into packs or large
  communal groups, bennu shifters tend to keep to tight-knit family units. These
  family bonds are deeply valued, often spanning generations and rooted in
  shared traditions tracing back to their ancient Egyptian origins. Bennu
  shifters are rare and tend to be private by nature, preferring to pass down
  their history, customs, and knowledge of their abilities within the family
  rather than through broader supernatural communities.
abilities: Bennu shifters possess the power of fiery regeneration—upon death, if
  their body is set aflame, they are reborn from the ashes with their wounds
  healed and their strength fully restored. They are stronger and faster than
  ordinary humans, and they are completely immune to fire and heat. When they
  unleash their power, bennu shifters can summon blazing wings capable of
  carrying them short distances and burn objects or opponents with a mere touch.
  They can also shapeshift into a heron, staying true to the ancient bird form
  of their bennu ancestors.
