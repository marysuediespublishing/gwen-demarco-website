name: Fae
slug: fae
description: The Fae are a proud and often haughty species whose history
  stretches back long before recorded human memory. They dwell primarily in
  their own realm, separate from the mortal world, ruled by the powerful Queen
  Maeve. Though they look entirely human and share a similar lifespan, many
  possess specific and formidable magical abilities—command over water,
  lightning, precognition, healing, and more. They operate by rules that seem
  nonsensical to mortals.

physicalTraits: Ethereally beautiful with features too perfect to be human.
cultureNotes: Fae society is ruled by Queen Maeve—although many of the Fae
  banished to the human realm no longer consider themselves her subjects and
  feel no loyalty to a queen who cast them out. The Fae often carry a deep
  superiority complex, viewing themselves as above humans and shifters in both
  lineage and power.
abilities: Powerful magic that can reshape reality, create illusions, and
  enchant objects and people. Can travel between the mortal realm and Faerie
  with permission from the queen.

The Fae are beings of immense power and pride, a species whose history predates humanity's own. They play by rules mortals can barely comprehend and often view themselves as superior to all other beings.
