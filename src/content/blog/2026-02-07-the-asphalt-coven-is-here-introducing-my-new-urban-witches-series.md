### **Starting Over Has Never Been So Magical**

You know I love writing heroines who are rebuilding their lives. Sophie Feegle found the supernatural on her examination table. Gideon Bean discovered that seeing the truth was the most dangerous gift of all. And now there's Darby Hendricks, a recently divorced accountant who moves to a new city for a fresh start and accidentally stumbles into witchcraft.

She wasn't looking for magic. She was looking for an affordable apartment that didn't have black mold.

### **Meet Darby**

Darby has spent the last few years losing herself inside a marriage that shrank her world down to nothing. When she finally gets out, she's broke, lonely, and starting from scratch in Medeon, a fictional rust-belt city full of crumbling factories, faded murals, and people who know how to make the best of what they've got.

She has a new job at a small accounting firm, a new roommate she barely knows, and a desperate need for human connection that goes beyond arguing about whose turn it is to buy toilet paper.

What she doesn't expect is to find her people. And she definitely doesn't expect those people to accidentally form a coven of witches in a library basement.

### **Five Women. One Grimoire. Zero Idea What They're Doing.**

When a mysterious grimoire is discovered in the basement of Medeon's beautiful old public library, five very different women are bound together by ancient magic none of them knew existed. Suddenly, they're levitating, glowing, and discovering elemental abilities they can barely control.

And that's where the fun really begins.

There's Darby, who can feel every living plant in the city reaching toward her. There's Topaz, the barista-slash-aspiring-rockstar who can hold fire in her bare hands. Kara, the librarian who senses every current of air. Ivette, the no-nonsense grandmother who can feel electricity humming through power lines. And Jazmin, the teenager who can make water defy gravity.

Five women. Five elements. One very old spell book and absolutely no instruction manual.

### **Covens, Coffee Shops, and Found Family**

If you've read any of my other books, you know found family is my favorite thing to write. Asphalt Coven is built on it. These women aren't bound by blood; they're bound by magic, by choice, and by the kind of fierce loyalty that comes from navigating the impossible together.

Between coven meetings in a library basement, coffee dates at a cozy café called The Golden Apple, and pizza nights in cramped apartments with mismatched furniture, these women build something real. They teach each other to be brave. They call each other out. They show up.

And they're going to need every ounce of that bond, because they're not the only ones who know about witches.

### **The Torch Bearers**

The supernatural world in this series exists hidden alongside our own, but not everyone is content to let it stay that way. The Torch Bearers are an ancient faction with roots in the Inquisition, and they haven't forgotten their mission. When they set their sights on Darby's coven, these five women have to figure out how to fight back with magic they've barely learned to use.

The stakes are real. The danger is real. And the choices they'll have to make will change them forever.

### **What You'll Find in This Book**

* A divorced heroine rebuilding her life who discovers she has earth magic
* A found family coven of five very different women learning witchcraft together
* A fiercely protective grandmother who swears in rapid-fire Spanish when things go sideways
* A teenage artist who can bend water to her will
* A charismatic barista with fire in her hands and secrets you won't see coming
* Ancient witch hunters with a terrifying agenda
* A gritty fictional city with a personality all its own
* Book club meetings that accidentally turn into magic lessons
* Loyalty, betrayal, and the kind of bonds that survive the fire

### **Same World, New Story**

Sharp-eyed readers will notice that Asphalt Coven shares the same world as the Sophie Feegle series; though Medeon is an entirely fictional city. I wanted a setting that didn't borrow from any single real place but instead captured the feeling of those gritty, underdog cities where community is everything and people look out for each other because nobody else will.

This is a different kind of magic from what we've seen before. It's elemental and ancient, inherited through bloodlines and unlocked through sisterhood. The grimoire, the rituals, the slow discovery of what each woman can do – I had so much fun building this magic system, and there's so much more to explore.

### **A New Series, A New Coven**

Asphalt Coven is the first book in what I hope will be a long journey with these women. There are secrets still buried in that grimoire, a larger magical world waiting to be discovered, and a whole lot of story left to tell.

If you loved Sophie Feegle's snarky attitude and found family, if you enjoyed Gideon Bean's hidden world of supernatural secrets, I think you're going to love Darby Hendricks and her coven of accidental witches.

### **Where to Find It**

Asphalt Coven is available now on Amazon in Kindle and paperback formats. It's also in Kindle Unlimited for KU subscribers!

Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to discover you had magic inside you all along? Sometimes the most powerful thing in the world isn't a spell, it's the people standing beside you when you cast it.
