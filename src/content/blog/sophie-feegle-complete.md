### The End of an Odd Journey: Sophie Feegle Series Complete!

It's official – the Sophie Feegle series is complete! From *Sophie and The Odd Ones* to *Odds and Ends*, our favorite snarky morgue worker has faced down shifters, outwitted wizards, tangled with Fae royalty, and somehow found her place in San Francisco's hidden supernatural world.

I'm emotional, I'm proud, and I'm so grateful to everyone who joined Sophie on this wild ride.

### Five Books, Countless Corpses

When I first introduced Sophie Feegle in 2020, I had no idea where her story would take us. What started with a tiny idea – what if you were a magical being and didn't know it? – grew into something bigger than I ever imagined. The whole series began with a single image in my head: Sophie in a morgue, finding a tattoo hidden beneath her hair that had locked her magic away. Three years and five books later, here we are.

I knew Sophie was sarcastic. I knew she worked with the dead. And I knew that her life was about to get very, very complicated. What I didn't expect was how much I'd fall in love with writing her, and how much readers would fall in love with reading her.

### The Journey So Far

1. ***Sophie and The Odd Ones*** – Where it all began. Sophie's life changes forever when she discovers she can see a person's final moments – and what those visions reveal is a hidden world of shifters, ogres, vampires, and Fae living among humans. Oh, and she's not entirely human herself.
2. ***Portents and Oddities*** – Sophie starts dreaming about the dead before they end up on her autopsy table. When a serial killer begins hunting San Francisco's Mythicals, Sophie and the Odd Ones must track the killer down before they become the next targets.
3. ***Odd Times for Sophie Feegle*** – Bizarre murders threaten to expose the Mythicals just before a massive supernatural festival, and Sophie gets sent to investigate – partly to solve the case, and partly because a wolf shifter pack back home wants her dead. The catch? The Conclave wants her working with her newly discovered sister Ruby, who's bubbly, cheerful, and a "reformed" serial killer.
4. ***Against All Odds*** – Everything Sophie thought she knew about herself shatters. She's not human. Her memories have been stolen. She's a shard – a fractured piece of someone who angered the Fae queen. And Ruby isn't her twin sister; she's another shard. Now the Odd Ones are racing to find the remaining pieces before someone else does – a hunt that takes them from San Francisco to an illegal shifter fight club in Las Vegas.
5. ***Odds and Ends*** – The finale. Everything has been building to this. Sophie must face Queen Maeve, confront the truth about who she was, and fight for the future of the Odd Ones. Threads that have been weaving since book one finally come together – and yes, there's a happily ever after.

### What Made Sophie Special

Sophie Feegle was never meant to be a chosen one in the traditional sense. She's not a warrior princess – she's a woman who works at a morgue and uses her brain (and her sharp tongue) to survive. Yes, she discovers she has abilities she never knew about, and yes, her origins turn out to be far stranger than she could have guessed. But at her core, Sophie is someone who stumbled into an impossible situation and figured it out as she went. She complained the whole time, of course, because that's who she is. But she showed up. She did the work. She protected the people she loved, even when it was terrifying.

That's what I loved most about writing her.

### The Found Family I Never Expected

One of the greatest joys of this series was watching Sophie build her found family. The outcasts and oddballs who gathered around her – Reggie, Ruby, Larry, Ace, Birdie, Burg, and so many more – became as important to me as Sophie herself. Writing their relationships, the banter, the loyalty, the slowly earned trust, was worth every late night at the keyboard.

And then there's Mac. My grumpy fox shifter detective who went from suspicious and closed-off to fiercely protective and hopelessly in love with Sophie over the course of five books. Writing his slow-burn romance with Sophie – and the way it all comes together in Odds and Ends – was one of my favorite things about this entire series.

### For the Box Set Readers

If you're new to Sophie and want to binge the whole series, the Sophie Feegle Box Set has all five books bundled together. Perfect for a supernatural reading marathon!

### What's Next

Just because Sophie's story is complete doesn't mean I'm done writing. I've got new worlds to explore, new snarky heroines to introduce, and new grumpy love interests waiting in the wings.

*The Kingdom of Erishum* trilogy is already complete for those who want sweeping cozy fantasy. The *Auras & Embers* series is underway for readers who want more urban fantasy with auramancers and phoenix fire. And the *Witches of Kirra Cross* is bringing magic to the gritty industrial streets of Medeon, where a coven forms in the shadows of smokestacks and crumbling row houses.

But Sophie will always hold a special place in my heart. She was my first completed series, and finishing her story feels like both an ending and a beginning.

### Thank You

To everyone who read Sophie's books, left reviews, sent messages, and asked "when's the next one coming?" – thank you. You made this journey possible. You made it worth it.

Sophie Feegle might be the one who deals with the dead, but you brought her story to life.

What's your favorite moment from the Sophie Feegle series? I'd love to hear which scene stuck with you!
