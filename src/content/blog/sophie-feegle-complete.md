It's official—the Sophie Feegle series is complete! From **Sophie and The Odd Ones** to **Odds and Ends**, our favorite snarky morgue worker has faced down shifters, outwitted ogres, and somehow found her place in San Francisco's supernatural underworld.

I'm emotional, I'm proud, and I'm so grateful to everyone who joined Sophie on this wild ride.

## Five Books, Countless Corpses

When I first introduced Sophie Feegle in 2020, I had no idea where her story would take us. I knew she was sarcastic. I knew she worked with the dead. And I knew that her life was about to get very, very complicated.

What I didn't expect was how much I'd fall in love with writing her, and how much readers would fall in love with reading her.

## The Journey So Far

1. **Sophie and The Odd Ones** - Where it all began. Sophie discovers that supernatural creatures are real, and they're turning up dead on her examination table.

2. **Portents and Oddities** - Sophie digs deeper into the supernatural world, facing new dangers and new allies.

3. **Odd Times for Sophie Feegle** - The stakes rise as Sophie's two worlds collide in unexpected ways.

4. **Against All Odds** - Sophie faces her greatest challenges yet, testing everything she's learned.

5. **Odds and Ends** - The finale. The conclusion to Sophie's story that I hope does justice to everyone who's been reading along.

## What Made Sophie Special

Sophie Feegle was never meant to be a chosen one. She's not supernaturally gifted. She doesn't have a prophecy hanging over her head. She's just a woman who's really good at her job and really bad at staying out of trouble.

That's what I loved most about writing her. Sophie represents all of us who stumble into impossible situations and figure it out as we go. She complains the whole time, of course, because that's who she is. But she shows up. She does the work. She protects the people she loves, even when it's terrifying.

## The Found Family I Never Expected

One of the greatest joys of this series was watching Sophie build her found family. The outcasts and oddballs who gathered around her became as important to me as Sophie herself. Writing their relationships—the banter, the loyalty, the slowly earned trust—was worth every late night at the keyboard.

And yes, there's a grumpy love interest. Some of you know exactly who I'm talking about. His journey from grumpy to... slightly less grumpy (but still protective and growly) was one of my favorite arcs to write.

## For the Box Set Readers

If you're new to Sophie and want to binge the whole series, the **Sophie Feegle Box Set** has all five books bundled together. Perfect for a supernatural reading marathon!

## What's Next

Just because Sophie's story is complete doesn't mean I'm done writing. I've got new worlds to explore, new snarky heroines to introduce, and new grumpy love interests waiting in the wings.

The Kingdom of Erishum trilogy is already complete for those who want fantasy adventure, and the Auras & Embers series is kicking off for readers who want more urban fantasy goodness.

But Sophie will always hold a special place in my heart. She was my first completed series, and finishing her story feels like both an ending and a beginning.

## Thank You

To everyone who read Sophie's books, left reviews, sent messages, and asked "when's the next one coming?"—thank you. You made this journey possible. You made it worth it.

Sophie Feegle might be the one who deals with the dead, but you brought her story to life.
