I am SO excited to share something new with you today! **The Mudlark** is now live, and with it begins the **Kingdom of Erishum Trilogy**—my very first epic fantasy series!

## Stepping Into a New World

If you've followed me through the Sophie Feegle series, you know I love urban fantasy—snarky heroines, grumpy love interests, and supernatural creatures hiding in modern cities. But I've always had a love for epic fantasy too, and the Kingdom of Erishum has been brewing in my imagination for years.

This trilogy is different from what I've written before, but it still has everything I love to include: a heroine who refuses to give up, a slow-burn romance with a wonderfully grumpy male lead, and found family forged in the most desperate circumstances.

## Welcome to Erishum

The Kingdom of Erishum was once a land of power and plenty. Ancient magic flowed through the blood of its rulers, and the wilds teemed with life.

Now the wilds are dying.

A mysterious blight spreads across the land, corrupting everything it touches. The nobility hide in their gilded towers while the common people struggle to survive. And at the very bottom of society—lower than farmers, lower than servants—are the mudlarks.

## Meet Our Heroine

A mudlark is someone who scavenges the riverbanks for anything of value. Coins, lost jewelry, scraps of metal—anything that can be sold for enough coin to survive another day. Our heroine has known nothing else. She has no name that matters, no family that claims her, no future worth dreaming about.

Until she finds something in the mud that changes everything.

Suddenly, the girl from the riverbank has the attention of very powerful people. In the Kingdom of Erishum, that kind of attention is rarely good.

## What You'll Find in This Trilogy

- **An underdog heroine** who rises from nothing through sheer determination
- **A grumpy love interest** who sees past the mud to the strength within
- **Found family** among society's outcasts and survivors
- **Dark fantasy world-building** with ancient magic and deadly politics
- **Monsters in the wilds** called Hyvas that will haunt your dreams
- **An epic scope** that spans a kingdom fighting for survival

## The Weird and Wonderful Goes Epic

Even though this is epic fantasy instead of urban fantasy, you'll still find my love for the weird and wonderful woven throughout. The Kingdom of Erishum has its own strange creatures, its own dark corners, and its own brand of magic that comes with a terrible price.

And of course, there's romance. Slow-burn, enemies-to-allies-to-more, with a male lead who growls more than he smiles. Just the way we like them.

## A Complete Story

Here's something exciting: I'm planning to release all three books of the trilogy within a year. By the time you finish The Mudlark and are desperate for more, The Gutter Shrike and The Dying Wilds won't be far behind.

No waiting years between installments. The complete journey from mudlark to hero, from dying wilds to (hopefully) salvation.

## Where to Find It

The Mudlark is available now on Amazon in Kindle and paperback formats. It's also in Kindle Unlimited for KU subscribers!

*Have you ever felt like you were starting from nothing? Like the odds were stacked against you? This trilogy is for everyone who has ever had to rise from the mud.*
