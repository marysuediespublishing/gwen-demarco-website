People often ask me about my writing process. How do I go from a vague idea to a finished book? What does a typical writing day look like? How much coffee is involved?

The answers are: chaotically, there's no such thing as typical, and more than you'd think.

Let me walk you through how a Gwen DeMarco book comes to life.

## It Starts With "What If"

Every book I've written began with a question I couldn't stop thinking about.

*What if a morgue worker discovered that supernatural creatures were dying in suspicious ways?* That became Sophie and The Odd Ones.

*What if someone could see the truth in everyone's aura—and that made her a target?* That became Gideon Bean.

*What if a mudlark pulled something impossible from the riverbed?* That became The Mudlark.

I don't start with plot. I start with premise and character. The plot emerges from asking "what would happen if this person was in this situation?"

Once a "what if" grabs me, I can't let it go. I'll think about it in the shower, while making dinner, at 2 AM when I should be sleeping. Eventually, I have to write it just to get it out of my head.

## The Planning Phase (Such As It Is)

I'm somewhere between a plotter and a pantser—what writers call a "plantser." I need a general sense of where I'm going, but I don't outline every scene.

Before I start writing, I know:
- Who my protagonist is and what she wants
- Who the love interest is and why they'll clash/connect
- The main conflict or mystery
- Roughly how it ends
- Two or three key scenes that I'm excited to write

Everything else? I figure it out as I go. Characters refuse to do what I planned. Better ideas emerge. The story takes turns I didn't expect.

Some writers find this terrifying. I find outlines more terrifying—they make my brain feel trapped.

## The Actual Writing

Here's where the romance with coffee deepens.

My writing schedule revolves around real life. I'm a wife and mom with teenagers, which means writing happens in the margins: early mornings, lunch breaks, after everyone's in bed. I don't have a dedicated writing cave (though I dream about one).

On good days, I can get 2,000-3,000 words down. On hard days, 500 words feels like pulling teeth. I've learned not to judge the words during the first draft—that's future editing Gwen's problem.

I write chronologically, mostly. I might skip ahead to write a scene I'm excited about, but usually I experience the story in order alongside my characters. It helps me maintain their emotional arc.

And yes, I talk to my characters. Out loud. The family has learned to ignore it.

## The Messy Middle

Every book has a messy middle. That section around 40-60% where the initial excitement has faded, the ending feels impossibly far away, and you're convinced you've forgotten how to write.

This is normal. I tell myself this every single time, and every single time I forget to believe it.

Getting through the messy middle requires:
- Lots of coffee
- Rereading the scenes that made me excited about the book
- Trusting that I've done this before and it worked out
- Sometimes, taking a day to brainstorm my way out of whatever corner I've written myself into
- More coffee

The messy middle is where the magic happens, actually. It's where the subplots come together, where characters surprise me, where the story becomes more than my original idea.

It just doesn't feel magical at the time.

## The First Draft Is Garbage (And That's Okay)

I've given myself permission to write terrible first drafts. This took years to learn.

The first draft is me telling myself the story. It's rough, it's repetitive, there are plot holes I'll need to fix. Characters change eye color. I'll write "[look up what this is actually called later]" and move on.

The goal is getting the story down. Making it good comes later.

If I tried to make every sentence perfect on the first pass, I'd never finish anything. The perfectionist in me had to learn to sit down and be quiet until revision time.

## Revision: Where Books Become Books

This is where I earn my wine.

First revision is structural: Does the plot make sense? Are the character arcs complete? Does the pacing work? This is where I add scenes, cut scenes, rearrange chapters.

Second revision is line-level: Tightening prose, fixing awkward dialogue, making sure the voice is consistent. This is where Sophie gets snarkier and grumpy heroes get grumpier.

Third revision is polish: Catching typos, smoothing transitions, making sure every scene earns its place.

Then beta readers get it. They catch things I'm too close to see. They tell me when the romance isn't swoony enough or when a plot twist doesn't land. Their feedback shapes the final version.

## The Coffee Factor

People joke about writers and coffee, but it's not really a joke in my house. Coffee is essential equipment.

Morning coffee: Motivation to open the document.
Mid-morning coffee: Fuel for the difficult scenes.
Afternoon coffee: Questionable decision that I'll make anyway.
Evening: Switch to wine if word count goals are met.

My family knows that talking to me before the first cup is risky. They adapt.

## The Emotional Rollercoaster

Writing a book is an emotional experience. I live inside these characters for months. I feel their heartbreak, their triumph, their frustration with grumpy love interests who won't use their words.

Finishing a book is bittersweet. Relief, satisfaction, and also a strange grief—these characters who lived in my head are now going out into the world. They don't belong to just me anymore.

But then a new "what if" starts whispering, and the whole beautiful, chaotic process begins again.

*Now if you'll excuse me, I have a grumpy hero who isn't cooperating and a coffee cup that needs refilling.*
