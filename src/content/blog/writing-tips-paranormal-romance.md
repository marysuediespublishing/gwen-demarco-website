After writing multiple series and falling in love with countless characters, I've learned a few things about crafting paranormal romance that resonates with readers. Here are my top tips for anyone looking to write in this wonderful genre.

## 1. Your Heroine Should Be Relatable First, Supernatural Second

Whether your protagonist is discovering hidden powers or navigating a world of shifters and vampires, she needs to feel *real*. Sophie Feegle works in a morgue. Gideon Bean has spent her life hiding. These are grounded, relatable situations before the supernatural elements enter the picture.

Give your heroine problems we all understand—work stress, family complications, feeling like an outsider. Then layer the supernatural on top. When readers connect with who she is as a person, they'll follow her anywhere.

**The key question:** If you stripped away all the magic, would your character still be interesting?

## 2. Grumpy Heroes Need Hidden Depths

I love a grumpy male lead. You know the type—growls more than he smiles, walls up, protective to a fault. But here's the thing: the grump needs a *reason*.

My favorite broody heroes aren't grumpy just because it's sexy (though it is). They're guarded because they've been hurt. They're overprotective because they've lost someone. They growl because showing vulnerability terrifies them.

When you reveal what made them this way, readers fall hard. The moment that grumpy exterior cracks to show the softness underneath? Pure reader gold.

## 3. World-Build Through Character Eyes, Not Info Dumps

Nobody wants a three-page explanation of shifter hierarchy in chapter one. Instead, let your protagonist discover the supernatural world naturally—and make her as confused and overwhelmed as your readers would be.

Sophie didn't know ogres existed until one turned up dead on her examination table. Her shock, her disbelief, her gradual acceptance—that's the reader's journey too. We learn about the supernatural underworld as she does, one revelation at a time.

**Pro tip:** If your character would find something surprising or strange, describe it that way. If it's normal to them, keep it brief. Match their emotional response to the information.

## 4. Found Family Hits Different

There's something magical about characters who aren't blood relatives choosing each other. The misfit crew. The ragtag team. The strangers who become closer than any family could be.

In paranormal romance, found family serves double duty. It shows your supernatural world has community and culture. It gives your protagonist people to protect and be protected by. And it creates opportunities for humor, conflict, and heart.

My favorite found families include:
- The unlikely ally who becomes a ride-or-die friend
- The grumpy mentor who secretly cares
- The comic relief character who sees everything
- The silent protector with a mysterious past

## 5. Balance the Paranormal and the Romance

This sounds obvious, but it's tricky to execute. Too much supernatural action and the romance feels rushed. Too much romance and the paranormal elements feel like window dressing.

My approach: the supernatural and romantic plots should intersect. The danger they face together builds intimacy. His protective instincts create tension. Her abilities make her valuable—and vulnerable. The external threat forces them to trust each other.

When the paranormal conflict drives them together instead of serving as a backdrop, you get that addictive blend readers crave.

## Bonus: Embrace the Weird

Paranormal romance lets you break rules. Your hero can have scales or fangs or wings. Your heroine can see auras or talk to the dead. Lean into what makes supernatural romance different from contemporary romance.

The weird stuff is what we're here for. An auramancer who knows when everyone is lying? A morgue worker examining supernatural bodies? A mudlark who finds something impossible?

That's the magic. Literally.

## Go Write Something Wonderful

Every paranormal romance starts with "what if?" What if supernatural creatures lived hidden among us? What if one woman could see the truth in everyone? What if love found you in the most impossible circumstances?

Find your "what if" and run with it. Make us believe in your world. Make us root for your characters. Make us stay up way too late because we have to know what happens next.

*That's the goal, isn't it?*
