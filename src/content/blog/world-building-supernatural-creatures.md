One of my favorite parts of writing urban fantasy is creating the supernatural beings that live hidden among us. Over three series, I've built out a whole ecosystem of creatures, each with their own abilities, cultures, and secrets.

Today I'm pulling back the curtain on the supernatural world. Consider this your field guide to the weird and wonderful.

## The Hidden World

Before we dive into specific creatures, let's talk about the world they inhabit. In my books, the supernatural exists right alongside our mundane reality. It's not a separate dimension or a hidden realm—it's *here*, in our cities, our neighborhoods, our workplaces.

Supernatural beings have spent centuries perfecting the art of blending in. Most humans go their entire lives without realizing their neighbor is a shifter or their coworker can see auras. The supernatural community protects its secrecy fiercely, because exposure would mean chaos.

Of course, some humans do find out. Usually by accident. Usually in ways that complicate everything.

## Shifters

Shifters are perhaps the most common supernatural beings in my worlds. They're humans who can transform into animals—one specific animal per shifter, determined by bloodline and heritage.

**What makes them interesting:**
- Each shifter type has its own culture and hierarchy
- The animal influences personality (wolf shifters are pack-oriented, cat shifters are more solitary)
- Shifting is painful, especially for new shifters who haven't learned control
- They heal faster than humans but aren't immortal
- Strong emotions can trigger unwanted shifts

In the Sophie Feegle series, Sophie encounters several shifter types, each with their own community and politics. The supernatural underworld isn't one unified group—it's dozens of factions navigating alliances and rivalries.

## Vampires

Yes, I write vampires. No, they don't sparkle. (Sorry, not sorry.)

My vampires are predators who have learned to exist among humans without hunting them... mostly. They're old, they're powerful, and they have very long memories.

**Key characteristics:**
- Immortal but not invincible
- Heightened senses and strength
- Complex political structures built over centuries
- Can create new vampires, but rarely do—it's a significant commitment
- Sunlight is uncomfortable rather than fatal (but they still prefer the night)

What I find interesting about vampires is the weight of immortality. They've watched empires rise and fall. They've outlived everyone they loved. That changes a person—or creates a monster, depending on how they handle it.

## Ogres

Ogres in my books aren't the fairy tale variety. They're massive, impossibly strong, and surprisingly intelligent. They just let everyone assume they're simple-minded because it gives them an advantage.

**What makes them unique:**
- Physical strength that dwarfs other supernatural beings
- Excellent memory and strategic thinking
- Often work as enforcers or protectors in the supernatural community
- Fiercely loyal once trust is earned
- They really, really don't like being underestimated

Sophie encounters ogres in her morgue work, and let me tell you—examining a body that large requires creativity. These are beings who don't fit neatly into human-sized spaces or human-sized categories.

## Fae

The fae are perhaps the most dangerous beings in my supernatural world. Not because they're the strongest—but because they operate by completely different rules.

**What you need to know:**
- They cannot lie, but they're masters of misleading truths
- Deals with fae are binding—literally, magically binding
- They're alien in their thinking, with priorities that don't align with human or even other supernatural values
- Iron weakens them
- They're ancient, and they never forget a slight or a favor

When fae appear in my books, the stakes immediately escalate. Other supernatural beings are dangerous but understandable. The fae are dangerous because they're *not*.

## Auramancers (Auras & Embers)

In my newest series, I introduced auramancers—humans with the ability to see auras. These aren't supernatural beings in the traditional sense. They're humans with a gift that makes them invaluable and endangered.

**Auramancer abilities:**
- See the colors that surround every person
- Detect emotions through aura shifts
- Know when someone is lying (deception has a specific color)
- Sense supernatural beings (their auras are different from human ones)
- With training, can potentially manipulate auras

Gideon Bean is an auramancer, and her ability to see through every lie and detect every hidden emotion makes her a target. The supernatural underground has many uses for someone who can see the truth.

## Bennu Shifters (Auras & Embers)

The bennu are my take on phoenix mythology. These are shifters who transform into massive fire birds—and yes, they have all the phoenix trappings.

**Bennu characteristics:**
- Can shift into a form of fire and feathers
- Regenerate from what should be fatal wounds (though it costs them)
- Run hot in all ways—temperature, emotion, protectiveness
- Ancient lineage with their own codes and traditions
- Protective of what they consider theirs

In Gideon Bean, the bennu play a significant role. When one of these fire-aligned shifters decides you're under his protection, good luck convincing him otherwise. They're intense, possessive, and absolutely terrible at expressing emotions in words.

Just the way we like them.

## Hyvas (Kingdom of Erishum)

In my fantasy series, the hyvas are something different—monsters in the truest sense. They're corruption given form, creatures that emerge from magical decay.

**What makes them terrifying:**
- They spread corruption wherever they go
- They were once something else before being twisted
- They multiply in areas of magical instability
- Killing them requires specific knowledge and abilities
- They're symptoms of a deeper problem with the world's magic

The hyvas represent a different kind of supernatural—less hidden society and more existential threat. The Kingdom of Erishum trilogy deals with what happens when the magical ecosystem starts breaking down.

## The Supernatural Ecosystem

What I love about building these supernatural worlds is showing how all these beings coexist. There are alliances and rivalries, territories and neutral grounds, laws and those who break them.

The supernatural community isn't a monolith. Shifters don't speak for vampires. Fae don't care about ogre politics. Each group has its own priorities, its own secrets, its own history.

When my protagonists stumble into this world, they're not just discovering that the supernatural exists—they're navigating a complex web of relationships and power dynamics that have been building for centuries.
