I'm thrilled to announce that **Gideon Bean** is now live on Amazon! This marks the beginning of a brand new series—**Auras & Embers**—and I couldn't be more excited to introduce you to Gideon and the supernatural underground she's about to discover.

## A New Kind of Gift

You know I love writing heroines with unique abilities. Sophie sees the supernatural dead on her examination table. Our mudlark found something powerful in the riverbank. And now there's Gideon Bean—a woman who can see the colors that surround every person, sense their emotions, and know when someone is lying.

She's an auramancer. And that makes her very, very valuable to some very dangerous people.

## Meet Gideon

Gideon has spent her whole life hiding. When you can see the truth in everyone around you—every lie, every hidden emotion, every dark intention—you learn quickly that staying invisible is the only way to survive.

She's built a life around anonymity. Stay under the radar. Don't draw attention. Don't let anyone know what you can really see.

But when Gideon witnesses something she can't explain and catches the attention of the supernatural underground, that carefully constructed invisibility shatters. Suddenly, the woman who can see everyone's secrets has secrets of her own that powerful beings are willing to kill for.

## Phoenix Fire and Hidden Worlds

The supernatural underground exists right alongside our reality—invisible to most, but thriving in the shadows. And among its most fascinating inhabitants are the bennu shifters.

Think phoenix mythology meets urban fantasy. Fire, rebirth, and abilities that can burn you to ash if you're not careful. When one of these bennu shifters decides that protecting Gideon is his personal mission, things get... complicated.

He's grumpy. He's overprotective. He growls more than he smiles.

Just the way we like them.

## What You'll Find in This Book

- **An auramancer heroine** who sees the truth everyone tries to hide
- **A grumpy bennu shifter** whose fire burns as hot as his protectiveness
- **Found family** among the outcasts of the supernatural underground
- **A unique magic system** where lies become visible and emotions have color
- **Hidden organizations** with their own agendas for someone with Gideon's gifts
- **Slow-burn romance** with plenty of tension and growling

## The Weird and Wonderful Continues

If you've read the Sophie Feegle series, you know I love building worlds where supernatural creatures live hidden among us, where found family matters more than blood, and where snarky heroines fall for grumpy heroes.

Auras & Embers has all of that, plus a new magic system I'm absolutely in love with. Auramancy—the ability to see auras—provides such a unique lens for storytelling. Every character's true nature is visible to Gideon. Every lie, every hidden emotion. Imagine navigating a world of dangerous supernatural beings when you can see exactly how dangerous they really are.

It's terrifying. It's exhilarating. And it makes for some really fun scenes.

## A New Series, A New Beginning

Gideon Bean is the first book in what I hope will be a long journey into this new world. I have so many stories to tell in the Auras & Embers universe, and this is just the beginning.

If you loved Sophie Feegle's snarky attitude and found family, if you enjoyed the Kingdom of Erishum's underdog heroine and slow-burn romance, I think you're going to love Gideon Bean.

## Where to Find It

Gideon Bean is available now on Amazon in Kindle and paperback formats. It's also in Kindle Unlimited for KU subscribers!

*Have you ever wished you could see the truth in everyone around you? Sometimes the gift of seeing clearly is the most dangerous ability of all.*
