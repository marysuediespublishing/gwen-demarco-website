I'm thrilled to announce that **Gideon Bean** is now live on Amazon! This marks the beginning of a brand new series, **Auras & Embers**, and I couldn't be more excited to introduce you to Gideon and the supernatural underground he's about to discover.

## A New Kind of Gift

You know I love writing main characters with unique abilities. Sophie Feegle received visions of a person's final moments on her examination table. Our mudlark found something powerful in the riverbank. And now there's Gideon Bean, a man who can sense the magic that surrounds every creature, feel the true nature of their power, and track the invisible trails they leave behind.

He's an auramancer. And that makes him very, very valuable to some very dangerous people.

## Meet Gideon

Gideon has spent his whole life hiding. When you can see things no one else can, things that shouldn't be real, you learn quickly that staying invisible is the only way to survive.

He's built a life around anonymity. Stay under the radar. Don't draw attention. Don't let anyone know what you can really see.

But when a murdered woman crawls out of his crematorium oven with wings of fire and tells him he's not crazy, that carefully constructed invisibility shatters. Suddenly, the man who's been hiding from the supernatural world discovers that powerful beings have plans for someone with his gifts.

## Phoenix Fire and Hidden Worlds

The supernatural underground exists right alongside our reality, invisible to most, but thriving in the shadows. And among its most fascinating inhabitants are the bennu shifters.

Think phoenix mythology meets urban fantasy. Fire, rebirth, and abilities that can burn you to ash if you're not careful. When one of these bennu shifters recruits Gideon to help track down her own killer, things get... complicated.

She's snarky. She's fierce. She growls more than she smiles.

Just the way we like them.

## What You'll Find in This Book

* **An auramancer hero** who sees the truth everyone tries to hide
* **A mischievous bennu shifter** whose fire burns as hot as her protectiveness
* **Found family** among the outcasts of the supernatural underground
* **A unique magic system** where lies become visible and emotions have color
* **Hidden organizations** with their own agendas for someone with Gideon's gifts
* **Slow-burn romance** with plenty of tension and growling

## The Weird and Wonderful Continues

If you've read the Sophie Feegle series, you know I love building worlds where supernatural creatures live hidden among us, where found family matters more than blood, and where snarky characters fall for the ones who least expect it.

Auras & Embers has all of that, plus a new magic system I'm absolutely in love with. Auramancy, the ability to sense magical auras, provides such a unique lens for storytelling. Every creature's true nature is detectable to Gideon. Every magical signature, every hidden power. Imagine navigating a world of dangerous supernatural beings when you can sense exactly how dangerous they really are.

It's terrifying. It's exhilarating. And it makes for some really fun scenes.

## A New Series, A New Beginning

Gideon Bean is the first book in what I hope will be a long journey into this new world. I have so many stories to tell in the Auras & Embers universe, and this is just the beginning.

If you loved Sophie Feegle's snarky attitude and found family, if you enjoyed the Kingdom of Erishum's underdog heroine and slow-burn romance, I think you're going to love Gideon Bean.

## Where to Find It

Gideon Bean is available now on Amazon in Kindle and paperback formats. It's also in Kindle Unlimited for KU subscribers!

*Have you ever wished you could see the truth in everyone around you? Sometimes the gift of seeing clearly is the most dangerous ability of all.*
