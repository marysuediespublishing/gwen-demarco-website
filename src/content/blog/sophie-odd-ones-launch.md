I'm beyond excited to announce that **Sophie and The Odd Ones** is now live on Amazon! This marks the beginning of Sophie Feegle's journey into San Francisco's supernatural underworld, and I can't wait for you to meet her.

### When the Dead Start Getting Weird

Sophie Feegle was desperate for a job. So when a kind stranger in a trench coat offered her a position as an autopsy assistant at the San Francisco Medical Examiner's office, she wasn't about to say no. The work was straightforward enough – weigh, measure, photograph, take notes. The dead don't talk back, they don't cause drama, and they definitely don't have supernatural secrets.

Or so she thought.

When bodies start turning up on her examination table that are decidedly not human, Sophie's new job takes a sharp turn into the extraordinary. Shifters, ogres, vampires – turns out they're all real. They're also all dead. And someone is responsible.

### Meet Sophie

Sophie is exactly the kind of heroine I love to write – snarky, practical, and completely unprepared for the chaos that's about to enter her life. She's not a chosen one or a secret princess. She's just a woman who's scrappy, adaptable, and very bad at dealing with the living.

When her new world collides with the supernatural community hiding in plain sight, Sophie handles it the only way she knows how: with dark humor, stubborn determination, and a lot of muttered complaints.

A Grumpy Love Interest (My Favorite Kind)

Of course, Sophie doesn't navigate this new world alone. Along the way, she meets a certain grumpy detective who growls more than he smiles. He's protective, mysterious, and absolutely terrible at expressing emotions.

Just the way we like them.

### What You'll Find in This Book

* A snarky heroine who says exactly what she's thinking
* A grumpy love interest with hidden depths
* Found family among the oddballs and outcasts
* Urban fantasy San Francisco where supernatural secrets lurk in every shadow
* A paranormal mystery that will keep you guessing

### The Weird and Wonderful

This book represents everything I love about urban fantasy – the blend of the mundane and the magical, characters who feel real even when their world isn't, and the discovery that family isn't always who you're born to.

Sophie Feegle is just the beginning. I have so many more stories to tell in this world, and I hope you'll come along for the ride.

### Where to Find It

Sophie and The Odd Ones is available now on Amazon in Kindle and paperback formats. It's also in Kindle Unlimited for KU subscribers!
