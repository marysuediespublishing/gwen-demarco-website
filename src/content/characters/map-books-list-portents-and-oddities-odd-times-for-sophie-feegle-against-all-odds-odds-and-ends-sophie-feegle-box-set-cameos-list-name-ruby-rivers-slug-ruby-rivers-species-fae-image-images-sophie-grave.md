name: Ruby Rivers
slug: ruby-rivers
description: "Ruby Rivers is Sophie Feegle's identical twin sister —
  black-haired and an exact physical copy of Sophie, though the resemblance ends
  at the surface. A self-described vigilante with a rap sheet that got her
  thrown in jail before the Conclave's leader Marcella broke her out, Ruby
  possesses a supernatural gift that allows her to see whether someone has
  committed murder simply by touching them. What makes Ruby truly unnerving is
  the jarring contradiction at her core: she's a \"weird mix of Disney-PG and
  psychopathic murderer,\" a woman who can vault onto a wolf shifter's back and
  plunge a knife into his neck, then collapse into giggles about it moments
  later. Her personality is pure psycho cheerleader — relentlessly bubbly,
  emoji-texting, stranger-hugging, candy-shop-squealing energy that bowls over
  everyone she meets, from Sophie's elderly neighbor Birdie to the warlock
  detective Larry Turner, whom she flirts with shamelessly. Despite Sophie's
  best efforts to maintain radio silence, Ruby moved into the building directly
  across the street from her sister's apartment and texts her daily with a
  persistence that borders on stalkerish. She's fiercely loyal, physically
  fearless, and completely unbothered by social cues, the kind of person who
  corrects someone calling her a murderer with a cheerful \"I prefer vigilante\"
  without a shred of irony."
