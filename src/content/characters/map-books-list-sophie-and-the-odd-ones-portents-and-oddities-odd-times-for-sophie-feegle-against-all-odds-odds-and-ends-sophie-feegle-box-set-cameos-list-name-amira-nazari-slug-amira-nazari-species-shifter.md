description: "Amira is a cat shifter who works the graveyard shift as the
  Pathology Transcriptionist at San Francisco's morgue — and moonlights as the
  neighbor's pampered pet cat in her off hours. Effortlessly sophisticated and
  glamorous, she has flawless olive skin touched with a hint of terra cotta,
  large dark eyes, prim features, and a jet-black braid she coils around her
  head like a crown or lets fall in dramatic, silky swishes when she's making a
  point. Her lips are perpetually painted in shades of dark red and burgundy,
  and she moves like a ballerina — graceful, sure, and deliberate, with an
  economy of movement that makes everything she does look intentional. She is
  every inch a cat in human form: aloof and imperious one moment, delicately
  shuddering at bad smells the next, eating fish for lunch every single day, and
  casually pushing things off Ace's desk with one finger while maintaining
  intense, irate eye contact. Beneath the queen-of-the-castle attitude and the
  eye rolls lies a woman of surprising steel. When Sophie is falling apart after
  experiencing a violent death through her visions, it's Amira who drags her
  aside and tells her to activate her \"bitch face\" — because being a bitch,
  she declares, is the one true strength of womanhood. She's the kind of friend
  who will hand you a glass of wine and let you cry, but only after making sure
  you hold your shit together when it counts. She wears a thin pink collar with
  her name on it, and she is absolutely not embarrassed about it."
