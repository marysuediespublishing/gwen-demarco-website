name: Reggie Didel
slug: reggie-didel
description: Dr. Reginald "Reggie" Didel is the Chief Medical Examiner in charge
  of the graveyard shift at San Francisco's morgue — and secretly, an opossum
  shifter. Soft-spoken and a little pudgy beneath his knee-length gray trench
  coat, Reggie has thinning blonde hair, wide-set dark brown eyes, and the kind
  of round, pale baby face that makes pinning down his age impossible — he could
  pass for anywhere between his thirties and fifties. Everything about him
  radiates kindness and quiet competence, from his soft, dry handshake to the
  way he excitedly explains the science behind vampire blood cells or exclaims
  with scientific glee over a headless, handless corpse. He slips easily into
  mentor mode, patiently guiding Sophie through the grim mechanics of autopsies
  while sharing green apples from his paper-bag lunch. Beneath the gentle,
  unflappable exterior — the man who says "ah, dang" and wrings his hands when
  he's worried — lives a fierce loyalty that surprises people. He'll almost
  snarl at a homicide detective to defend the truth of Sophie's visions, stand
  his ground against Mac's bluster to protect his team, and bet his own money on
  a stranger's courage when everyone else wagers she'll fail. As a
  lesser-kingdom shifter, Reggie knows what it's like to be underestimated and
  dismissed by the powerful, which is precisely why he offered a broke, tattooed
  woman a job in a bar — because she needed a break, and because the same
  instincts that told him she could be trusted also told him she'd once saved
  his life with a piece of rusty fence and her last apple.
