name: Sophie Feegle
slug: sophie-feegle
description: "Sophie Feegle is a scrappy, sharp-tongued young woman in her
  mid-twenties living on the edge of broke in San Francisco. Small and
  pixie-faced with black hair, tattoos peeking from her sleeves, and a wardrobe
  built from dark jeans, band tees, second-hand leather boots, and a worn black
  peacoat, she carries herself with enough edge that her landlord compares her
  to a \"goth Tinkerbell.\" Beneath the tough exterior and foul mouth lies a
  fierce tenderness — she's the kind of person who will give her last apple to a
  cornered opossum and check on her elderly neighbor before collapsing into bed.
  Street-smart and quick with her fists, Sophie relies on sharp instincts and a
  wicked sense of humor to navigate a life that hasn't given her many breaks.
  When she lands a job as an autopsy assistant on the graveyard shift at the
  city morgue, she discovers she has an unexpected supernatural gift: visions of
  the dead's final moments that could help solve the cases crossing her table.
  Equal parts grit and heart, Sophie is the kind of woman who stares down a
  snarling dog in a dark alley, knees a stalker in the face, and then asks her
  boss if he needs anything else before the shift ends."
