name: Gideon Bean
slug: gideon-bean
description: Gideon is earnest, quietly kind, and deeply reluctant. He's a
  working-class guy with two jobs and a crappy hatchback who keeps trying to bow
  out of the supernatural world — he's not qualified, he's going to end up in a
  cardboard box like the bodies he deals with at the crematorium. Frankly, he
  needs to get back to work. But when it actually matters, he's incredibly
  brave. He rolls himself into a fire to save Dacey. He grabs a ghost with his
  bare hands. He has a quiet moral backbone — he calls Dacey out on her lying
  and refuses to keep working with her unless she's honest. He's the everyman
  who steps up despite every instinct telling him to run.
