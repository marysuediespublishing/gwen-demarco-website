name: Dacey Menet
slug: dacey-menet
description: Dacey Menet is a bennu shifter and fixer for the Conclave — the
  woman you call when supernatural problems need solving and you don't mind a
  little fire along the way. With tanned skin, thick wavy dark hair, and an
  elfin, heart-shaped face, she's striking even before you notice the ring of
  flame that flickers in her dark eyes when her emotions run hot. Bold,
  mischievous, and fearless to the point of reckless, Dacey throws herself into
  danger with a grin and drags everyone around her along for the ride. She's the
  kind of woman who bursts out of a crematorium oven with wings of blazing fire
  and her first words are a complaint about her favorite dress. Sparks crackle
  through her hair when she's agitated, she skips across rooms when she's
  excited, and her idea of testing a theory is unleashing her fire wings over
  pancakes. Dacey doesn't do cautious. She doesn't do subtle. And when someone
  she cares about is in danger, she becomes an avenging angel of phoenix fire —
  fearless, furious, and utterly unstoppable.
