name: Fitz
slug: fitz
description: Fitz is a snow goose shifter who works the graveyard shift as the
  Transporter and Intake Specialist at San Francisco's morgue — the man
  responsible for receiving, weighing, and x-raying the dead before they reach
  Reggie's scalpel. By far the tallest person in the room, Fitz is very thin,
  almost gangly, with bony elbows poking from his shirt sleeves and a long neck
  capped by a prominent Adam's apple. He has pale, milk-white skin, corn-silk
  blonde hair, and light, almost silvery eyes, giving him a Nordic look — though
  without the Viking brawn you'd expect from someone with that heritage. Despite
  his lanky frame, Fitz moves with a surprising, almost avian elegance, gliding
  rather than walking, his long fingers with their pronounced knuckles handling
  everything from forks to flashlights with an understated grace. He is
  relentlessly, hilariously territorial. Every can of sparkling water in the
  breakroom fridge is labeled with an individual post-it note bearing his name.
  His desk, his computer, and his equipment are not to be touched, and god help
  the day-shift worker who steals one of his drinks — Fitz will vow to find the
  culprit with the righteous fury of a goose defending its nest. His great
  passion is bread. He plows through mixing bowls of plain lettuce and entire
  baguettes, huffs a bag of sourdough like a junkie, delivers animated
  monologues about the importance of a good starter, and once proposed marriage
  to Sophie on the spot after she brought him a loaf from Boudin. Beneath the
  imperious long-nosed stares and the territorial fussiness, Fitz is quietly
  thoughtful — reserved by nature but gentle with the vulnerable, the first to
  suggest the group rest after a crisis, and the one who proposes they make a
  list of movies to force Sophie to watch because he wants her to feel included.
  His family runs a crematorium, a detail that proves disturbingly convenient
  when the team needs to dispose of a body and no one else wants to ask how.
