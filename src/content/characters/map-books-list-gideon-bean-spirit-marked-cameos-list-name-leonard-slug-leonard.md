name: Leonard
slug: leonard
description: Leonhard is a mystery to Gideon. They've talked on the phone and
  exchanged emails, but he's never met the man face-to-face. For all Gideon
  knows, Leonhard could be a seven-foot-tall bodybuilder or a ninety-year-old
  grandfather. His voice doesn't give much away either. What Gideon does know is
  that the Numerai has a knack for sniffing out patterns that no one else can
  see, connecting dots across mountains of data like he's reading a children's
  picture book.
