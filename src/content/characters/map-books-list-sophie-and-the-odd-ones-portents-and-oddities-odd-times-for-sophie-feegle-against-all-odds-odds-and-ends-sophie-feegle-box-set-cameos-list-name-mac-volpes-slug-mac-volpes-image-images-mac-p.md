name: Mac Volpes
slug: mac-volpes
description: Detective Malcolm "Mac" Volpes is a fox shifter in his early
  thirties who works homicide cases tied to San Francisco's hidden Mythical
  community. Standing about five-ten with a lean, muscular build that carries
  the coiled grace of a dancer and the swagger of a cocky boxer, Mac cuts an
  effortlessly sharp figure — even when he looks like he hasn't slept in days.
  His light brown, wavy hair is perpetually tousled and in need of a cut, and a
  few days' worth of scruff usually shadows a jawline sharp enough to cause
  problems when he finally bothers to shave. Beneath dark, heavy brows, his deep
  ocean-blue eyes can shift from glacial intimidation to unexpected warmth in
  the span of a heartbeat. Typically found in rumpled charcoal suits with a
  notebook in hand, Mac is blunt, growly, and naturally distrustful — traits
  that come with the fox territory. He leads with authority and a snarl, the
  kind of man who barks orders and walks away fully expecting everyone to
  follow. But beneath the gruff, "Detective Dickhead" exterior lives a
  sharp-witted, quietly bookish man who drives a sensible gray sedan, quotes the
  history of City Lights Booksellers, grew up as a small-town police chief's
  son, and grins like trouble when he's enjoying himself. His protectiveness
  reveals itself not in soft words but in growled commands, borrowed jackets,
  and the stubborn refusal to let the people around him face danger alone.
