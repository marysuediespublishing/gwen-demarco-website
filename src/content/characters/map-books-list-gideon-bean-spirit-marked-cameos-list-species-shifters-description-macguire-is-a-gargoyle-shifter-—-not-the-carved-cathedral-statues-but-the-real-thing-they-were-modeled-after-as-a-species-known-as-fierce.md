name: MacGuire
slug: macguire
description: "MacGuire is a gargoyle shifter — not the carved cathedral statues,
  but the real thing they were modeled after. As a species known as fierce
  protectors, MacGuire serves as the muscle on Conclave missions, the backup
  called in when suspects might give trouble. He's thin and bespectacled with
  narrow features, sharp blue eyes, and a pale complexion that makes him look
  more like a mild-mannered accountant than a mythical guardian of stone. But
  his magic tells a different story: to Gideon's auramancer senses, shaking
  MacGuire's hand feels like grasping a weathered boulder, all surprising
  firmness and underlying grit, as if his palm had just grazed a brick wall.
  There's a creature of legendary strength hidden beneath that unassuming
  exterior — it's just a shame MacGuire seems to know it. He carries himself
  with a slightly pompous air, his reserved expression transforming into
  something smarmy whenever he gets an audience. He delights in making people
  guess what he is, and when he announces \"gargoyle,\" he says it like he
  expects applause. Dacey has flat-out refused to have him assigned as her
  handler — \"he gets on my nerves\" — and Gideon suspects they'll never be
  friends. But respect? That's harder to shake. Beneath the smugness is a symbol
  of protection, whether MacGuire acts like it or not."
