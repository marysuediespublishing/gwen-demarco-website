name: Burg
slug: burg
description: Burg is an ogre who owns and operates The Little Thumb, the
  century-old pub next door to Sophie's apartment building Brown Betty. In his
  human glamor, he looks like he stepped off a turn-of-the-century circus poster
  advertising old-timey strongmen — a giant of a man with a melon-sized bald
  head that catches the morning sun like a beacon, a thick dark mustache, gray
  eyes that spark with good humor, and a nose with a large lump in the middle as
  if it's been broken more than once. He keeps a white bar towel perpetually
  thrown over one shoulder and does everything with the practiced flourish of a
  born performer — flipping coasters, depositing drinks, swishing his towel with
  dramatic flair, giving Italian chef's kisses when joking that humans taste
  delicious. His thick arms cross over a barrel chest when he's issuing
  warnings, and when his anger rises, it pulses off him in almost visible waves
  that make him look even more massive than usual, his name alone enough to make
  vampires stutter and gang members flee. In his true ogre form — which Sophie
  describes as "completely terrifying" — Burg's enormous trapezoid muscles skip
  his neck entirely and connect directly to the base of his skull. His skin is
  thick and rubbery with bristles like a wild boar (a detail Sophie vows to take
  to her grave), his hands can grip flat concrete and scale the vertical face of
  Coit Tower without breaking a breath, and his fists swing like hammers,
  leveling enemies like a machete through weeds. He lives above the bar, doesn't
  need much sleep, and spends his mornings hosing piss off the brick wall left
  by Mythicals who insist on marking their territory. The pub itself is his
  kingdom and museum — every square inch covered in tchotchkes his family has
  collected over a hundred years, including a Pablo Fanque circus poster, a
  glossy violin, and the original Jules Rimet World Cup trophy his father stole
  in 1984. The bar is named for an ogre fairy tale about Little Thumb — who,
  Burg confides, was actually an ogre himself, and a distant relation. But for
  all the menace he can summon, Burg is Sophie's protector, friend, and
  bartender-confessor rolled into one. He quietly upgrades her cheap whiskey
  when she's broke and pretends otherwise. He steps between her and a vampire
  gang without hesitation, declaring his block and everyone on it under his
  protection. He shudders at the sound of a rib cutter and lets a tiny human
  woman gross him out over drinks just because it makes her laugh. He warns her
  about the Fae with the quiet urgency of someone who knows exactly how
  dangerous the world is and wants desperately to keep her safe from it.
