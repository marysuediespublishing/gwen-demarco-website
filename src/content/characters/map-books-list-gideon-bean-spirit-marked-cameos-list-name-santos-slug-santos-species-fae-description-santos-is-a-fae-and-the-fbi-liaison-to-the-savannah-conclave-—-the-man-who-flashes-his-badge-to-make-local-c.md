name: Santos
slug: santos
description: Santos is a Fae and the FBI liaison to the Savannah Conclave — the
  man who flashes his badge to make local cops step aside and smooths over
  cross-agency territorial disputes. He's built like a bear, with a muscular
  frame that fills doorways, yet he moves with a grace that belies his size. His
  Fae ability is telekinesis — the power to move objects with just a thought —
  and his magic registers to Gideon's auramancer senses as a subtle buzzing
  vibration in the air around him, like standing next to a live wire. But it's
  not his powers that define him; it's his warmth. Santos is the teammate who
  wraps you in a bear hug the moment he sees you, who loads his plate with
  enough food to rival a bennu shifter's appetite, and whose easy, infectious
  grin makes everyone around him feel at ease. He's encouraging when
  investigations hit dead ends ("Sometimes confirming what we already know is
  valuable, too") and fiercely supportive of the people he cares about. When
  Gideon was recovering in the hospital after his first case, Santos visited
  multiple times — and it was Santos who mentored him through negotiating his
  Conclave contract, making sure he didn't sell himself short. He's been working
  with the reclusive Leonhard for over ten years and has never once met him
  face-to-face, which says everything about his patience and good humor. Santos
  is the steady, solid heart of the team — the one who makes you feel like you
  belong.
