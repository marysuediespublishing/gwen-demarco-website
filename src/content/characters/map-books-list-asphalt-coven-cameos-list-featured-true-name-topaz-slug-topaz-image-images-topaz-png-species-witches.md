name: Topaz
slug: topaz
description: >-
  Topaz is loud, magnetic, and absolutely on fire — sometimes literally. She's a
  purple-streaked, silver-ringed musician grinding through barista shifts and
  Uber fares while chasing a record deal, and she carries herself like someone
  who's already famous and the world just hasn't caught up yet. She's the kind
  of person who fills more space than her physical body occupies, who links arms
  with you on the sidewalk five minutes after meeting you and makes you feel
  like the coolest person alive.

  She's the one who finds Darby a place to live, a friend group, and a reason to stop shrinking. She's the one who yells "FUCK ROY!" on a public street until a stranger yells it back. She tells a teenager the truth about her friend's creepy older boyfriend with the kind of calm, unflinching honesty that makes you realize she's been looking out for people her whole life. She remembers Darby's coffee order after one visit — almond milk, one sugar — and shrugs it off like it's nothing.

  Her fire magic suits her perfectly. The flame leaps into her palm the first time they light a candle and she holds it there, unburned, wonderstruck. She shapes fire into claws and curved blades. She also sets a stranger's phone ablaze because he called Darby a bitch, and when Darby calls her on it, she's genuinely shaken — not by what she did, but by the realization she could have hurt someone. Her temper runs hot and her impulses run hotter, but her conviction burns brightest of all.

  She's the spark that lights the coven. Bold where Darby is cautious, reckless where Ivette is measured, fearless where Kara is careful. She's the friend who makes you braver just by believing you already are.
