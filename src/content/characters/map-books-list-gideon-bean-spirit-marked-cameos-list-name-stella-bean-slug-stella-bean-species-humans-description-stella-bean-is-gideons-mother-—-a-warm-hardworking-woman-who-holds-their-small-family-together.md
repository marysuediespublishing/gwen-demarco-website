description: "Stella Bean is Gideon's mother — a warm, hardworking woman who
  holds their small family together through long hours and quiet faith. She
  works as the cashier at the local hardware store, though in truth she
  practically runs the place: organizing schedules, managing inventory, and
  serving as the person everyone turns to when there's a problem. She'd never
  dream of asking for the manager title she's earned, insisting she's \"just the
  cashier\" even as the owner relies on her to keep everything running. Stella
  is the kind of mother who pulls out her special holidays-only tablecloth and
  best plates when her son brings home a friend, who swipes flowers from the
  apartment complex oleanders to make a centerpiece, and who can't quite hide
  the hopeful gleam in her eyes at the thought that Gideon might finally have
  someone in his life. She's religious without being pushy, gently inviting
  Gideon to church while respecting when he declines. She worries about him —
  about his mental health, about his long hours, about the life he's building —
  but she shows her love through home-cooked breakfasts and quiet support rather
  than pressure. Gideon gets his complexion from her, and they're both
  world-champion blushers. She puts salsa on her eggs and thinks tomato-haters
  who love ketchup make no sense."
