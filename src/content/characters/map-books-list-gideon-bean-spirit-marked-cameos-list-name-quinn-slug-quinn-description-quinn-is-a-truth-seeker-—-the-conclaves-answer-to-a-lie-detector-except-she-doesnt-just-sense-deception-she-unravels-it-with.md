name: Quinn
slug: quinn
description: Quinn is a truth seeker — the Conclave's answer to a lie detector,
  except she doesn't just sense deception, she unravels it. With a short bob
  framing her face and a reserved, professional demeanor, Quinn doesn't waste
  time on pleasantries; when Gideon met her, she didn't offer her hand to shake,
  just a quick, fleeting smile. Her power requires eye contact, and once she has
  it, her voice drops to something soothing and low, almost hypnotic. To
  Gideon's auramancer senses, her magic is unlike anyone else's — quiet, subtle,
  creeping. Where other Mythicals announce themselves with obvious magical
  signatures, Quinn's power works like tendrils of persuasion gently wrapping
  around her target, washing over the mind in waves of ease and trust. It feels
  like a comforting hand guiding you to spill your deepest secrets — and Gideon
  found himself nearly answering questions meant for someone else before he
  caught himself and dug his fingernails into his palm to stay grounded. She's
  the one called in when the team needs answers, whether from a clueless
  coworker or a murder suspect in pajamas. Quinn conducts her interrogations
  with calm control, though Gideon caught her physically swallowing her anger
  when Mr. Peterson admitted he'd looked the other way on suspicious bodies for
  cash. She takes her work seriously — and when she looked over at Gideon before
  questioning Linus, she smiled like she was excited to show off. Secrets don't
  stay buried long when Quinn's in the room.
