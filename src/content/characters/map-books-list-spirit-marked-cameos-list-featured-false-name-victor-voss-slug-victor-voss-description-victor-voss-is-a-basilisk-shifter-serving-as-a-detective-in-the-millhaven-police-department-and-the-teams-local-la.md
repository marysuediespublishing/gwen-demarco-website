description: >-
  Victor Voss is a basilisk shifter serving as a detective in the Millhaven
  Police Department and the team's local law enforcement liaison. Beneath his
  human glamour, he hides vertical pupils like a viper's that examine everyone
  with unblinking intensity — a detail visible only to Gideon's auramancer
  sight.

  He's tall, with blonde hair neatly combed back from his forehead, a navy suit, and precise, deliberate movements that carry just a hint of the reptilian. His voice has a slight rasp to it, and he has a way of taking up position near a window and watching the room in perfect stillness, his gaze fluid and unblinking. Gideon's skin crawls every time they shake hands — partly because of his lifelong discomfort around snakes, and partly because Voss makes no effort to hide his interest in Dacey.

  He carries himself with the quiet authority of a man who knows his territory — "This is Millhaven, for God's sake. Things like this don't happen here." He's cooperative, helpful, and seems genuinely invested in the investigation. But his lingering presence around Dacey and a growing list of suspicious absences raise more than a few eyebrows as the case deepens.
