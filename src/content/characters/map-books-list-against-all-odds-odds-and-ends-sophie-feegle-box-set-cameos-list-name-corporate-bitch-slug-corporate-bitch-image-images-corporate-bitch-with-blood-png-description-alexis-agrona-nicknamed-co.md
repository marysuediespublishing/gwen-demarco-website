name: Corporate Bitch
slug: corporate-bitch
description: 'Alexis Agrona, nicknamed "Corporate Bitch" by Sophie and Ruby long
  before they ever learned her real name, is a shard of the same unknown Fae as
  Sophie, and Ruby. Alexis is coldly power-hungry, driven by an unshakable
  belief that she deserves any power she is willing to seize. As Director of
  Acquisitions at Dolus Investments in Boston, Alexis earned her unflattering
  moniker through the shared dreams the sisters experienced — dreams that
  revealed a ruthless, ambitious woman who took visible pleasure in cruelty,
  most notably when she had employee Gabriel Cortez humiliated and dragged out
  by security during his termination for all his coworkers to witness. Alexis is
  cunning, calculating, and patient — traits that allowed her to orchestrate an
  elaborate deception. '
