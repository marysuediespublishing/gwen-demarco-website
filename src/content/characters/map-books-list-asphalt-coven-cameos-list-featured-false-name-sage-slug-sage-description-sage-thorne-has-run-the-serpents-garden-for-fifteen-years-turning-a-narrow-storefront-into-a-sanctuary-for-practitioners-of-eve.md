name: Sage
slug: sage
description: Sage Thorne has run The Serpent's Garden for fifteen years, turning
  a narrow storefront into a sanctuary for practitioners of every level. With
  long black hair, rings on every finger, and a serpent pendant at her throat,
  she looks exactly like the kind of woman who'd own an occult shop — and she'd
  be the first to appreciate the irony. Behind the jewel-toned layers and the
  warm, husky voice is a sharp mind backed by thirty years of magical practice.
  She sees more than she lets on, says less than she knows, and moves through
  her shop with the unsettling silence of someone who's very comfortable with
  the unknown. When the Medeon Coven walks through her door, Sage recognizes
  what they are before they're ready to admit it themselves.
