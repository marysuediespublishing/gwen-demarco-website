name: Wiz
slug: wiz
description: "Wiz is a wizard and member of the Conclave's investigative team —
  and one of the most powerful magic users Gideon has ever encountered, capable
  of leveling a city block if she wanted. You'd never guess it from looking at
  her. With wild curls framing a perpetually grinning face and a wardrobe of
  floral dresses that make her look like she just stepped away from a PTA
  meeting, Wiz radiates warmth and enthusiasm rather than raw magical power. Her
  magic feels like champagne bubbles to Gideon's auramancer senses — sparkling
  and effervescent, perfectly matching her bubbly personality. She's the team
  member who calls out \"There's my favorite duo!\" from a car window, who
  squeezes everyone in hugs, and who giggles her way through hotel lobbies while
  casually making check-in happen hours early with a wave of her hand. Wiz
  handles the team's magical heavy lifting — containment spells, knockout
  incantations, fast-tracked search warrants — all while maintaining an
  exuberance that contrasts sharply with her more reserved teammates. When
  Gideon makes a good call on an investigation, she's the first to welcome him
  officially: \"Good job today, Agent.\" It's good to be the Wiz, and she knows
  it."
