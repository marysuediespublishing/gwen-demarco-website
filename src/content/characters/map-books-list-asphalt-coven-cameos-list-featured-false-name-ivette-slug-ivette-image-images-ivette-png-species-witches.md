description: >-
  Ivette is fierce, grounded, and nobody's fool. She's a Puerto Rican freight
  dispatcher who raised her granddaughter since she was three, buried a daughter
  lost to addiction, and still cooks Pollo Guisado in the crockpot like she's
  feeding an army because she can't help it — she's Puerto Rican. She's compact
  and energetic, with laugh lines and a neat bun and the kind of no-nonsense
  authority that makes teenagers obey and grown women listen.

  Her first instinct when magic enters her life is to make the sign of the cross. Her second instinct is to protect Jazmin. She's the one who says they should stop practicing entirely if it means keeping her granddaughter safe — and she means it, completely, even though giving up her own power would cost her something real. When the group decides to fight instead of hide, she doesn't sulk or drag her feet. She pivots immediately: "If we're going to do this, then we do it smart." That's Ivette in a nutshell — she'll argue fiercely for caution, but once the decision is made, she's all in.

  She fries her work computer because a rude driver pissed her off. She volunteers as a test dummy for binding spells so Jazmin can practice safely. She erupts into rapid-fire Spanish profanity when the situation calls for it, then calmly insists they never tell a soul what they are. She's the grandmother who hands you a plate and a lecture in the same breath — the one who loves you enough to be the voice of reason when everyone else is running hot.
