name: Nyssa
slug: nyssa
description: Nyssa is a slim, agile young woman with dark hair who works as an
  experienced mudlark in the kingdom of Erishum, scavenging the banks of the
  River Assur at low tide for items of value. Her slight build allows her to
  move across the treacherous mudflats with dancer-like grace, distributing her
  weight to avoid breaking through the riverbed's precarious surface. She
  prefers working near the south gate where the river flows in from the Dying
  Wilds, believing treasures from long-vanished lands might wash in from beyond
  the kingdom's walls. She carries herself like someone wise beyond her
  years—her innocence of youth replaced by the hard-earned wisdom of survival.
  She's caring and fiercely protective of those she loves, willing to speak hard
  truths even when it causes friction, and willing to risk her own safety for
  those she cares about. Despite her difficult circumstances—living in a modest
  dwelling with a straw pallet and scraping by day after day—she harbors dreams
  of leaving mudlarking behind to become a baker's apprentice, saving coin to
  pay the entry fee and buy her yellow apron. She's resilient, street-smart, and
  deeply loyal, someone shaped by hardship but not hardened by it.
