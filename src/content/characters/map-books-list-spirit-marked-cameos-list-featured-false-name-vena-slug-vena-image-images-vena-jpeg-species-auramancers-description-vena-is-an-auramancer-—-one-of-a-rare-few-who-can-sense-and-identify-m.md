slug: vena
description: >-
  Vena is an auramancer — one of a rare few who can sense and identify magic —
  and Gideon's mentor. She lives in South Carolina and flies in for his training
  sessions, but most of her guidance comes through phone calls and a steady
  stream of strange magical artifacts shipped to him for study. She's the reason
  his notebook has over thirty documented magical signatures.

  With her wispy silver hair and warm, worried voice, Vena feels like the grandmother Gideon never had. She frets over his safety and warns him about the dangers of being what he is — auramancers have been stolen before, including two of her own cousins, taken as children and never found. But beneath that protective concern is someone who genuinely lights up at a good magical mystery. When the investigation uncovers void magic that stumps everyone, Vena's response radiates excitement through a text message. No one knows magical history like she does, and if something has ever existed before, she'll find it.
