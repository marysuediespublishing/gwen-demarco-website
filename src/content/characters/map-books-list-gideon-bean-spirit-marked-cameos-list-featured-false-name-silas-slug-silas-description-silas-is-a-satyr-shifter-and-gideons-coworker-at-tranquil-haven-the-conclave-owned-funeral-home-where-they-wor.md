name: Silas
slug: silas
description: Silas is a satyr shifter and Gideon's coworker at Tranquil Haven,
  the Conclave-owned funeral home where they work the night shift together. He's
  also Gideon's training partner at the Conclave facility in Tallahassee, where
  they spend weekends on weapons training, physical conditioning, and
  hand-to-hand combat — sessions that have quietly transformed Gideon from a
  civilian into someone who can keep pace on a chase through the Florida
  woods.Silas is all bright eyes and easy grins — the kind of guy who quizzes
  Gideon on obscure Mythical species with the delight of someone playing a
  trivia game he knows he'll win. He's good-natured and supportive, but he's
  also the friend who will point at a girl's back and give an enthusiastic
  thumbs up while she isn't looking. Subtlety isn't exactly his strong suit —
  but loyalty is.
