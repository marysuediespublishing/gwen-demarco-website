name: Larry Turner
slug: larry-turner
description: "Detective Larry Turner — self-proclaimed \"Warlock
  Extraordinaire\" — is a charming chatterbox who looks less like a practitioner
  of the arcane arts and more like he should be fronting a ska funk band. He
  works for the Mythical division of the police force alongside Mac and under
  the Conclave's authority, combining detective work with genuine magical
  talent. Larry favors an old-timey gentleman aesthetic, complete with a fedora
  he tips like someone out of a black-and-white film and whips off with
  theatrical flourishes, paired with loafers and suit jackets. His personality
  runs to playful flirtation — he waggles his eyebrows like a wannabe gigolo,
  calls women \"sweetheart,\" and never misses a chance to tease Sophie about
  dumping Mac so she can \"have him all to herself.\" Beneath the showmanship,
  though, Larry is genuinely skilled: he can cast perimeter wards using nothing
  but a person's aura and chalk symbols, perform tracing spells, and conduct
  research through both traditional and magical methods. He's the kind of guy
  who shows up to a crime scene with coffee and donuts because he figured
  everyone might be hungry, and who tells Sophie and Ruby to get out of San
  Francisco before they cause more damage than an earthquake. By the end of the
  story, he's developed real feelings for Ruby — answering her early-morning
  calls with a sleepy, warm \"Hey, sweetheart\" — and proves himself loyal
  enough to come to Murias when the sisters need him most, holding Ruby in his
  lap like a small child after her ordeal."
