# The Dying Wilds

Beyond the walls and borders of the Kingdom of Erishum lie the Dying Wilds—a vast, untamed expanse that has claimed countless lives. Here, the Hyvas hunt in packs, and the very landscape seems hostile to human survival.

Yet the Wilds also represent possibility. For those with nothing to lose, the dangerous frontier offers an escape from the rigid social structures of the kingdom. Many who venture into the Wilds never return, but those who survive find a harsh freedom that the kingdom's streets could never provide.
