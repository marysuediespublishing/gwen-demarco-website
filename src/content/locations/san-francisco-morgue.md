# San Francisco City Morgue

The San Francisco City Morgue is far more than a repository for the dead. In the Sophie Feegle series, it becomes a nexus point where the human world intersects with the supernatural community. The sterile halls and examination rooms serve as neutral ground where creatures of the night must often deal with the consequences of their hidden existence.

For Sophie Feegle, the morgue represents both her professional dedication and her unexpected entry into a world she never knew existed. The cold, clinical environment provides a stark contrast to the warm, vibrant supernatural community she gradually becomes part of.
