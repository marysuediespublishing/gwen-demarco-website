# The Auras & Embers World

The world of the Auras & Embers series exists parallel to our own—a modern landscape where supernatural beings hide in plain sight. Auramancers can perceive the colored halos of life energy surrounding all living things, while Bennu shifters carry the ancient power of the phoenix within their blood.

This is a world where coffee shops might secretly cater to the supernatural community, where seemingly ordinary neighborhoods hide extraordinary secrets, and where those with magical gifts must constantly balance their true nature against the need for secrecy. For Gideon Bean and others like him, navigating this hidden world means trusting the right people—and surviving the wrong ones.
