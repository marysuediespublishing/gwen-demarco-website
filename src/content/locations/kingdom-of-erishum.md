description: A sprawling fantasy realm where political intrigue meets raw
  survival. The Kingdom of Erishum is a land of stark contrasts—gleaming noble
  courts standing above squalid city streets, ancient forests hiding deadly
  Hyvas, and a society where your birth determines everything, unless you have
  the courage to seize your own destiny.

# Kingdom of Erishum

The Kingdom of Erishum serves as the primary setting for Gwen DeMarco's epic fantasy trilogy. This is a world of sharp social divides, where the privileged nobility look down upon the mudlarks and gutter shrikes who scrape by in the city's lowest quarters.

The kingdom's geography spans from towering castles and ornate temples to the dangerous wilds at its borders, where monstrous Hyvas prowl. For those born into poverty, survival means mastering the art of theft, deception, and knowing when to run. Yet even in this harsh world, bonds of loyalty and unexpected love can flourish among those society has forgotten.
