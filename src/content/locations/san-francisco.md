# San Francisco

San Francisco's iconic fog, diverse neighborhoods, and layered history make it the ideal setting for urban fantasy. The city's reputation for embracing the unusual and unconventional extends to its supernatural population, who have carved out their own territories and traditions among the hills and valleys.

In the Sophie Feegle and Auras & Embers series, San Francisco becomes a character in its own right—a city where ancient pack territories overlap with modern tech startups, where vampire-owned businesses operate alongside trendy restaurants, and where magic flows through the very fog that rolls in from the bay.
