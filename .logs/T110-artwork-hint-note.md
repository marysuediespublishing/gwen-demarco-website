# T110 - Add "click thumbnail to see full image" note on Artwork page

## Attempt 1

**Approach:** Add a subtle hint note below the hero section on /artwork page. The hero already mentions clicking images in its description (line 148), but I'll add a more prominent yet unobtrusive visual hint with an icon between the hero and the first series group.

**Result:** Success

**Details:** Added a subtle hint note between the hero section and the first series group. The note includes:
- A click cursor icon (SVG) in mystic-teal color
- Text "Click on any thumbnail to see the full image" in italic fog-gray
- Centered layout with minimal padding
- Subtle border styling that blends with the dark theme

The hero section already mentioned clicking images in its description (line 148: "Click any image to view the full artwork"), but this new note provides a more visible visual cue that's consistent with the task requirements. Build passes successfully.
