# T067 - README.md

- Project description
- Tech stack summary
- How to run for development
- How to use Decap CMS locally
- How to add tasks and run the loop
- Deployment instructions
- Summary of what's been built

**Result:** Success

**Details:** Created comprehensive README.md covering:
- Project introduction and tech stack
- Getting started (prerequisites, installation, development, build)
- Decap CMS usage instructions with local backend
- Loop-based development system documentation
- Deployment instructions for GitHub Pages and manual hosting
- Project structure overview
- Summary of all pages, features, and content built
- Design theme color palette and typography

Build verified successfully.
