# T024 - Create Gideon Bean launch blog post

## Attempt 1

**Approach:** Create src/content/blog/gideon-bean-launch.md following the existing blog post format established in sophie-odd-ones-launch.md and kingdom-of-erishum-launch.md. The post will announce the Auras & Embers series, introduce Gideon Bean as the protagonist (an auramancer who sees auras), highlight the unique magic system and bennu shifters, and maintain Gwen's voice (snarky heroine, grumpy love interest, found family).

**Result:** Success

**Details:**
- Created blog post at src/content/blog/gideon-bean-launch.md
- Used frontmatter format consistent with existing posts (title, description, pubDate, bookSlug, tags, category, readingTime)
- Set pubDate to 2024-02-01 to match the book's publication date
- Content includes sections on: auramancy gift, meet Gideon, phoenix fire/bennu shifters, what you'll find in the book, weird and wonderful theme, new series intro, where to find it
- Maintained Gwen's voice with references to snarky heroines, grumpy love interests, and found family
- Build passed successfully with no errors
