# T118 - Add Facebook and Instagram links to Contact page

## Attempt 1

**Approach:** Add Facebook and Instagram links to the "Find Me Online" section on the Contact page. Will add them after the existing Goodreads link using consistent styling with emoji icons (to match existing Amazon and Goodreads links which use emoji characters). Links will open in new tabs.

**Result:** Success

**Details:** Added Facebook and Instagram links to the "Find Me Online" section on the Contact page. Used SVG icons matching the style used elsewhere on the site (icons are properly sized with w-5 h-5 class). Both links open in new tabs with proper security attributes (target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"). Links follow the same styling as existing social links (text-mystic-teal with hover:text-ember-orange transition).
