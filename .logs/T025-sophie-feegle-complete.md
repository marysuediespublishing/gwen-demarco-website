# T025 - Create Sophie Feegle series complete blog post

## Attempt 1

**Approach:** Create a celebratory blog post announcing the completion of the Sophie Feegle series. Will follow the established blog post format from other posts (sophie-odd-ones-launch.md). The post will:
- Celebrate the completion of all 5 books + box set
- Reflect on Sophie's journey from book 1 to the finale
- Thank readers who followed the series
- Include standard frontmatter (title, description, pubDate, tags, category, readingTime)
- Use a publication date of late 2023 (after Odds and Ends, book 5)

**Result:** Success

**Details:**
- Created src/content/blog/sophie-feegle-complete.md
- Initially used category 'announcements' which failed validation
- Fixed to use valid category 'book-launches' from schema enum
- Build verification passed successfully
- Blog post includes:
  - Celebratory title "The End of an Odd Journey: Sophie Feegle Series Complete!"
  - Summary of all 5 books in the series
  - Reflection on Sophie's character and what made her special
  - Found family theme discussion
  - Mention of box set for new readers
  - Teaser for other series (Kingdom of Erishum, Auras & Embers)
  - Thank you to readers
