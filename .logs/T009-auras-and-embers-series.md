- Include 2 books: Gideon Bean (2024) and Spirit Marked (2025)
- Include species: auramancers, bennu shifters based on D007
- Feature urban fantasy themes about aura reading and supernatural abilities

**Result:** Success

**Details:** Created src/content/series/auras-and-embers.md with:
- Frontmatter matching existing series format
